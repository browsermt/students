(Laughter) (Applause) CA: And you were also - I mean, you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on.
That sounds interesting. ""
There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character.
When you think of the future then, do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control, more secrecy, or us watching Big Brother, or it's just all to be played for either way?
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal - personally identifying information in it.
So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
I have to serve. ""
I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a person's race or religion.
So this is all of the meta-data information.
And when Kibaki got into power - through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya - they commissioned this report, spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report.
Oh, that's all my time?
CA: So, what was the impact of that?
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe - he's the director of UNAIDS.
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
In all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims, the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed.
But the core values: well, capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
And we got a report - a sort of engineering analysis into what happened - saying that, in fact, security guards from some rival, various competing oil firms had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies.
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
My uncle turned to the other men, and in Arabic said, "" Ibn abuh. ""
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation - that is his HIV / AIDS foundation.
I mean, did he?
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister, attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him, and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change, which is absolutely necessary.
I like to move beyond raising awareness.
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us.
By now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire: terrifying voices, grotesque visions, bizarre, intractable delusions.
And I was like, "" Hold on.
It doesn't matter where you are - Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
Can that possibly be true?
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.
I see this plus sign.
And we were like, "" Oh, tell us more.
(Laughter) So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "" The Harvesters "" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one.
This is Avelile - she goes with me wherever I go.
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.
JA: Well, I was a journalist.
CA: How does it work?
JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan - they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
Light 'em all up.
And I'm getting - the hairs on my - I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
JA: Yeah.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.
We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not, vet it like a regular news organization, format it - which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do, when you're talking about giant databases of information - release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.
Okay. Thank you very much.
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force.
These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
(Applause) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
(Applause) Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something.
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
Very simply, you go in - and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom - you can just zoom around.
On November 5th, 1990, a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that although I had been subjected to this violent, intolerant ideology, that I did not become fanaticized.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her - an adorable child.
CA: Wow, so your leak really substantially changed the world?
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
CA: And releasing this caused widespread outrage.
And that's it. Thank you.
Sadly, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not.
These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims, but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials.
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this - but I'm going to click this off right now.
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004.
Most of my life, I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, that all gay people were a negative influence.
CA: So that's the key bottleneck, basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries?
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all, and that's our hope.
You basically published something there, ran into trouble with a bank, then the news service there was injuncted from running the story.
I believe that Eleanor can get through this.
It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me.
And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is.
And that's something from my father and something from other capable, generous men that have been in my life.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat, the founder of Treatment Action Campaign, an incredible campaigner and activist.
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
This is a tool - this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
Actually, they're not.
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse.
Genocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied identity.
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded.
Now at first, I would have believed them.
That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
And there's a lot of information.
CA: So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
Thank you very much.
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say, Julian, be careful, and all power to you.
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
Is it really yours? ""
Avelile's mother had HIV virus - she died from AIDS-related illness.
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way - there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime.
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey.
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans.
Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization, we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth, and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information.
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.
My son isn't.
Solar technology is...
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story: what happened in Iceland?
So you have to be careful with hacker.
This is something you leaked a few years ago.
So this is my SING Campaign.
However, in every religion, in every population, you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do.
It was like, "" Don't mess with me.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do, and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela - out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done.
I had a great education - I'm not complaining - but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital - because we filmed her story - we didn't know if she was going to survive.
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
We are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects.
Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism, against the bigotry.
They work in the field.
And the voice persisted, days and then weeks of it, on and on, narrating everything I did in the third person.
I'd done well at school.
And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
Who's got the hero view?
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces.
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.
How dare you? ""
It's to supplement the experience.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner.
My name is Amit.
JA: So this is the Kroll Report.
So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya, in Tanzanian and South African press.
It's just a quick video of what we do.
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father.
Dangerous troublemaker.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not, or they get simply shelved, out of sight and out of mind.
You move around, you have fun.
So another one of my favorites, "" The Starry Night. ""
We are unique. We are irreplaceable.
As much as genocide is about killing.
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another, it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part, we all want the same things out of life.
- that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "" Yes, we can talk about this issue.
They have education programs.
In the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents, working together to promote dignity, solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress, to create a new language and practice of hope, which, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual.
You see that glass of water?
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access.
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self, each fragment represented by a different voice, gradually withdraw from all my medication, and return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus.
This type of society is not only possible, it's already on its way.
(CA: You would?)
You can see the bars of the window there.
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "" Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum? ""
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me.
You know, hero - people's hero - bringing this important light.
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.
Tell me about you. "" Thank you.
Then there was "" The Daily Show. ""
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus?
When we released that report, we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki, had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Daniel arap Moi, so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck.
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
She's a six-monther.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
In this respect, for members of society, there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone, to bear witness, to reach out a hand, to share the burden of someone's suffering, and to hold the hope for their recovery.
Hotel... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
This was a huge impact on my mind, because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I hadn't realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall.
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account, but what about your core values?
This is like one of our methods of identifying, of verifying, what a material is, is to try and get these guys to write letters.
And apparently it was quite popular.
And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
Any one of you, anybody - doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house - doesn't matter.
But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources?
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder, but while serving time on lesser charges, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Iceland's a Nordic country, so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there.
Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities, when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army.
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV.
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it. ""
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know, and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible.
Two years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.
(Applause) That's happened quite a lot though.
So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election - the national election, December 28.
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.
Now, we had released, early in the year, a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy, but this is not necessarily connected.
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions.
I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted, but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition.
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of.
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
Keep going. Have fun.
Instead, they publicized your side.
So, it was obviously - it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story.
You can go and create your own museum online - create your own collection across all these images.
JA: We would have released them.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
Two ways of going in - very simple.
To paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins, it cannot be reversed.
(Laughter) We'll just - we can just skip - I'll just skip through the video instead... (Laughter)
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified.
Iceland went through this financial crisis.
So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
This was the beginning. The voice had arrived.
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far - I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
I've got a plastic fork, don't you know? "" Strategic.
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
And that, after a couple of days, made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.
The light never goes out.
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult, so the combination between the two...
we need to move, time now!
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy.
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia.
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along...
I met him at a 46664 event.
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
(Laughter) CA: I mean, a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
Roger. I got 'em.
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
JA: So these are - as far as we can tell - classical whistleblowers, and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us.
This is - this is intense material, I should warn you.
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group.
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
But then you really want to go deep.
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.
One day toward the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish.
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization.
So let's take [an] example, actually.
(Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot' n. (Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n.
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street, and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone - looking for any excuse to do so - and killing people rescuing the wounded.
And so it came in from the outside.
If we can have this document up...
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying.
You can zoom around very simply.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby, has, in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined.
And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says, "" You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.
So what opened my eyes?
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.
(CA: Because?)
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
I'm a storyteller.
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV, shifted the vote by 10 percent, according to a Kenyan intelligence report, which changed the result of the election.
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice, the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement, an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy, a sane reaction to insane circumstances, not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured, but a complex, significant and meaningful experience to be explored.
JA: So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day.
JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information?
CA: Wow.
JA: We have denied receiving those cables.
Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years, it seems to me now as if someone died in that place, and yet, someone else was saved.
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them?
By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends.
You want to navigate around the museum?
So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID.
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in - because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other.
This is "" The Ambassadors, "" based in the National Gallery.
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full-time job.
These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses.
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.
And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air, like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk, and the news reader was like, "This has never happened before. What do we do?"
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, everybody. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thanks a lot. (Applause)
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims?
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
And just a month ago, this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.
I have so much money, it takes me forever.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
Anyway, so we release this report in July last year.
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.
CA: So they are well-motivated.
(Applause) CA: Here's - We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video.
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi, who was the richest man - still is the richest man - in Kenya.
It is also about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us, but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission, not to screw it up.
This can happen.
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have.
Now essentially, this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind, a kind of psychic civil war, and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing.
It really comes from these artists.
I wrote a magazine, was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.
The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip.
And in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened.
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see.
That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flames.
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life.
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables...
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this.
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
(Music) This is not... (Laughter)
Like father, like son.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years - I went to about 12 different countries.
CA: But are there risks with that, either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large, where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence?
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness.
What is this?
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it was severe.
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger?
There are always traces - no such thing as a perfect crime.
(Applause) Last question, Julian.
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump.
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about.
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range, which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI.
A subtle conditioning process had begun, the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.
It doesn't have to be in the closet. ""
In this case, I am merely a tool, a forensic, if you like, and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document.
(Laughter) CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership.
I mean, there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world - within the E.U., between China and the United States.
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
"She is going to a lecture."
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
So late last year - in November last year - there was a series of well blowouts in Albania, like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, but not quite as big.
CA: Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP?
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to...
