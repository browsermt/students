The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establish trust.
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
The last demonstration - can I take one minute?
And that was a hard one.
There are some light sources.
I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave.
Audience: What are you reading?
And because God loves her, I did get married.
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

On one side, all life on Earth needs energy.
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant.
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.
She's some other woman.
And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less.
Give me the statin. ""
What would you say to that?
However, we all copy what everyone else does, and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior, and this is where the private sector comes in.
Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person? ""
And when they went back out in the field, his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that's what happens.
I mean, our brief - it was pretty good, but not this good.
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color, and that's why you get synesthesia.
They are both right now on the run.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
Right? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see what's there, we never see information, we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.
I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night.
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
This is one reality.
And so we took a step back and we said, "What is it that we are trying to achieve?"
(Applause) But that's not all the drama yet.
Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?
It's a unique human feature.
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
(Laughter) They do.
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today?
Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene, diseases, from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date, 30,000 years ago, and some of those are from local chert, but more - but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in?
But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect, because we are not helping, we are not working for society, but we are working for privileged people, rich people, government, developers.
In all of us, it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else.
I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country?
They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.
She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks, and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life, and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant, and that if soap is used before touching the babies, we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers.
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court.
What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?
In fact, I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood.
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars, but don't tell my funding agencies.
This one is from Myanmar.
And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence.
The phantom limb - they'll say, "" But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
I don't know about you, but when I conceptualize this metaphor, what I picture is straight out of a cartoon - like there's a man, he's walking down the sidewalk, without realizing it, he crosses over an open manhole, and he just plummets into the sewer below.
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised - did fundraising.
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters], there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.
But rest assured, it was hard work.
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded.
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible.
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.
So, how did this happen?
And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them.
This is a floppy disk - five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
We need political leaders to recognize the problem, and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs, go to the visual areas in the brain.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place.
I felt like anyone could do that.
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here? Student: Yeah.
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
And it sounds so strange to me now, but at 22, I longed to have dramatic experiences, and in that moment, I was irrational and furious and devastated, and weirdly enough, I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me.
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted.
And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes, like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
You see him all the time.
I am for chocolate donuts.
However, I'd like to remind you of two things from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really relevant here.
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place.
Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls.

(Laughter) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love.
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.
Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness.
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle.
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it.
And specifically, I want to talk about what's wrong with how we talk about love.
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction, meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection - ki-ki, in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited - Kiki, mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity.
So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças.
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter) For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter) And you like technology, right?
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.
So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots - installed briefly in Madrid.
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated.
All right, get to know each other.
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work.
This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
Thank you very much.
We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
I said, "" Stop. This is nuts. "" I mean, you know.
Third is "" Gagnsæi. "" I was open to any questions.
They've all been combined together in this technology.
Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup, not very far from here.
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli - just like a baby and any other sane person.
I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question.
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom, my fear and resistance towards it intensified.
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain.
I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.
Why did you do it? "" And they all say the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me."
They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags, shopping carts, bicycles and carroças.
The problem lies with the microscope itself.
I mean, did he?
It's a cold war, really.
You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system.
So go ahead, Amy.
Last but not least, I don't need to explain that in this room, we ran on the principle of Girlpower.
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
Once recovered, these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned, analyzed, catalogued and stored.
They made his silly outfits, like this, (Laughter) and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way - there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime.
This isn't easy, either.
we need to move, time now!
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004.
I did not even make the graph in the newspaper.
(Laughter) It's just - it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good, except I told this to imaginary friends around me, which was not so good.
It's very important to mention this, because I did lose a lot of sleep, and I worked hard, and so did the people with me.
And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies, and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it.
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives.
What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they're cooperating, not how clever the individuals are.
So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors.
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.

And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots.
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards.
This has also gone through clinical trials, helping lots and lots of patients.
So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really.
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?
Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?
So, we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity.
Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war.

Of course, it got much better after that.
This is when we were thinking about the idea.
Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable, because if I could be miserable, then I would prove how much I loved him.
So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so - well, game - and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees?
But of course, with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls, maybe it's understandable.
De facto landmines.
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

Is the French pronunciation correct?
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor.
It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer - a negative test result that should have been positive.
Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles.
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
Same as the other side.
So, this is an example no one can argue with.
(Laughter) So I remember it was so disappointing.
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things.

Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently.
If you look at the first slide there, that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK - the lobes that constitute the brain.
How do you actually track them down?
It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.
I got young people to teach me how to do that, and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign.
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools.
So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.

In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you.
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen, and measure your galvanic skin response, and show pictures on the screen, I can measure how you sweat when you see an object, like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.
I see this plus sign.
The color coordination is very important.
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides.
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him.
And I said, "" Why would you do it this way? ""
It all depends on the way the person feels about change.
Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
I think you need to get to know the person next to you.
This is like one of our methods of identifying, of verifying, what a material is, is to try and get these guys to write letters.
Gibran Khalil Gibran, when he first started writing, he used Arabic.
A curious little invention is being talked about.
So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it.
So what is a Foldscope?
And guess who woke up?
(Whistling) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible.
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.
They say no.
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.
The question "" why? ""
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
(Applause) A bunch of pacifists.
(Laughter) So what happens when online criminals are caught?
You made a reference to it earlier. I'd love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill.
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing.
We're plugged in; we're connected.
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.

The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.
