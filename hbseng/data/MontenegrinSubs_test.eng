And it's time now for you to do yours.
But you're the boss, Walt.
We welcome you... and all those with you, into our court and into our hearts.
I've been calling you all week.
Just pinch her that's all.
Good people, Welcome.
Has to be fair.
And when was this?
And all you have to do is take a good look at him.
For the love of god, get on with it!
He didn't show it to anyone except me.
I'm giving you the truth.
Yeah, my plane's been delayed for several more hours, so I just wanted you to know.
Won't be easy. But I'll see what I can do.
We've lost our only lead.
You'll drown out there on your own, Tom.
I ask you, whether such dishonest and treacherous sons could ever have had an honest mother!
She feel no pain.
As CEO for Princefield Investments, I have called this press conference to address the recent allegations of insider trading at Fund 23.
Then I realized... it starts with a seed of anger.
I don't know.
Certainly not your attorney.
That's three hours from now, even if she left this minute.
All right, I am hanging up.
I don't think so.
Come, show me where you intend to dig these mines.
This case has just taken over my life.
You started this, mr.
I left Ellen Parsons' card on the table.
I've never heard his name, never seen him, nothing.
His Majesty wants you to know that the military campaign against the Scots has been a great success, and he is most pleased with Lord Hertford and his other Captains, who performed well in the field.
I think this could be the guy.
How old were you?
Are you not ashamed?
Did you hire a staff yet?
Yeah, but they're not your kids.
Mr. Moore insists on total anonymity.
Well, do you want it fast, or do you want it right?
I am a woman and I demand equal respect for my ideas!
What is this? - only a wife to a husband.
Viktor... thank you.
Were you able to?
You know, that's one of the points that we should make in the book, that hard work is only worth it in the right conditions.
Tell me, thomas.
Dad... dad!
Yeah, Perry.
Mr. Coupet, not me.
By then, 50,000 people will have jobs, and it won't look like a flip-flop.
Were there any letters for me?
We can still go after patty hewes.
Yeah, that's right.
It will state that the succession is now firmly vested in our children... and no others.
Which we can't find because you don't remember what part of town you were in.
If you insist,but I would much rather you did not.
Your Highness, for our purposes... this is no good.
In your medical opinion, is it possible Danielle died from a similar mixture?
I'm sorry to say it, but...
Do not divvy it up amongst the others, okay?
Well, who would then?
A lot of people aren't.
How much would it take for you to walk away?
I'll call good defense attorney for you.
However, this time we expect the people, being pardoned by our grace, to make further submissions in acknowledgments of their past depravities.
NYE: She'll see what I see, and she'll own you. MAN:
I'm surprised you're still in the city.
In the meantime, Tom, I want you to keep digging...
I doubt it.
Sir Thomas, you are likely to pay the ultimate price.
Why not?
But you should know, at this point... any change in representation is a risk.
I couldn't forgive myself if I left.
It turns out my son isn't gonna be expelled after all.
An American or Italian?
What is this?
Shortly after that confession, I'm correct... you made a phone call?
It had to be the ClA.
D... do you think this may have been done to you on... on purpose?
- Your Majesty.
But I can't.
Patty's making me do all this paralegal bullshit.
Joe, Joe! Wow.
Lots of women lie About the fathers of their children.
What did Wolsey used to call her?
We're lost.
She sat on the information, and you helped her with her case.
I'm still getting over this cold.
I know about Danielle Marchetti.
Tommy, what did you do?
All your wrestlers are better than mine?
You must know my reputation.
You're safe, rick.
It's no big deal.
But we got what we needed.
I understand if you need to think about it.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for - a hundred nights or more.
But tonight I will visit to your bedchamber.
It's moving!
I don't know.
you really did it?
We have gathered together a coalition of seven nations to bring stability to a region that has suffered from unrest for decades.
I'll stay here and watch her.
Are we still on for coffee?
Our forefathers, when they declared independence, understood the power of the individual, the value of self-determination.
Where the hell are we?
This came directly from Jerusalem?
If it were possible...
I-I just can't be involved.
Perhaps, it is none of my business,
I am not so used to everyone looking at me.
We always love coming here.
To be clear, this is far more than just a jobs package.
My daddy worked the coal mines.
- Thank you.
You can't.
doug schiff is on our side, but we need to convince his commission that this merger should not go through.
Yes,your majesty.
You've been threatened.
Did he threaten you?
What fancy, what folly has led and seduced you to make this most shameful rebellion against our most noble and righteous king and sovereign?
Yes, it seems that judge Reilly and the victims have lost their confidence in us. Us.
In view of your eminence's well-known piety, as well as your great learning and diplomatic skills I can assure your eminence of the support of the french cardinals at the conclave to elect a successor.
Nothing, Your Majesty.
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing the amendment tomorrow.
What, Ellen?
Your majesty.
Patty paid Purcell?
There appeared to be preparations for an invasion, encouraged by the Vicar of Rome.
You understand?
You run legal strategy by her, pick her brain.
I brought something that I thought might help.
It's clear the final report was doctored.
Well, that's easy for you to say, isn't it?
Technically speaking, you're having a hypnopompic hallucination.
- Ask him to deliver the traitor into your hands, Or face the consequences and our perpetual enmity.
- Thank you. So much for the Israelis stopping our resupply.
Let me help you.
- All rise for the King!
Congress is turning against you, Howard.
I'm looking to hire a private investigator, and I heard you retired from the police force.
You know me. My moves go unannounced.
No, no, no, uh, I'll be ready.
Instead of rescheduling, she handed me this stuffed animal.
Well, you're much more sympathetic than McClaren.
Dunbar claims she has it.
- You've got to leave.
High Star to deliver all of their documents on Dust Devil.
May I speak with you honestly?
Because of me...
Very well.
I brought a shipment of water
Sir John Seymour and his family.
You are going to own your own house now.
Get the master.
Is he so foolish that he'll turn down a Peerage, and a gift of one of the dissolved abbeys, if he agrees to marry you?
I must give thanks to our lady.
Tr?s bien.
Now, why?
Define ordinary.
Who are you kidding?
Ungrateful wretch that I am.
Did you see miss reynolds walk towards your vehicle?
Do you deny writing it?
Always so eager to have people like you.
Arthur Frobisher stole your future.
Because I want to feel powerful?
Is that what you just said?
While the government's action is tragic, it wasn't unlawful.
Well, you've had plenty of time, so if you ask for an extension, I'll fight you on it.
We can't let that happen.
For the plane?
So you, your mother, Carol...
Now, ladies, why don't we try on your new dresses!
"The impossible made possible.
Wonderful. Thank you.
I have come to see my daughter.
Thank you.
Okay, I will. For a few minutes.
He wouldn't tell me what it was.
Hi. I'm,uh,Ellen Parsons from the DA's Office.
Is everything okay, or.
- No shit?
- Those men of vile birth: lawyers, university men, Machiavellian intriguers whose only desire is the destruction of the nobility of this country.
As long as there is transparency and communication.
His excellency, ambassador eustace chapuys.
Hey, Patty, it's Ellen.
We need the UN to investigate the blast site.
You do it.
But would it surprise you to learn that one of your admirers is the King?
You know something, mister Brandon?
Don't bother countering.
The contaminant was present.
You know perfectly well why; I don't like it.
Nor by your first husband?
I just got a goddamn award.
I mean, the truth is that, um, well, I provoked Tobin and he decked me.
He's not gone, just in storage.
Your surrender doesn't interest her at all.
She is now 16, both a widow, and, apparently, still a maid.
I cannot believe that she is guilty of such abominable crimes...
Gitta and Ellen?
I think a trip to Maine in the winter'll do you both a world of good.
I thought we took care of this bitch.
- My Lady.
I called because I have a proposition.
Sweet anne.
I mean, look at us.
You must have resources, so... why do you need me?
- Forgive me, Ambassador Mendoza.
Bonjour monsieur I'ambassadeur.
Seduce me.
Just a trick.
He said he would happily die for you!
If you don't remove yourself, we'll turn you over to the U.S. attorney's office.
Now, Ms. Connor, if you permit me to cut to the chase... you claim that you saw these men together early morning on June 19, do you not?
My child, do you have a confession?
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
We're going to fight for all those women.
Jesus Christ, this fucking city!
Now, if this guy traces back to Frobisher in any way, we will find him.
- Thank you, Lord Risley.
My buddy-- he's got a cabin upstate.
Oh, these changes are good.
How would you like to suck the cock of a man who's a member of the Order of the Garter?
The only way you're going to make it here is with our support.
What do you suggest?
He loved her like a daughter.
Your eminences.
Is there anything else, Mr. Culpepper?
Fine with me.
I want to wear a wire.
The fight. Coming back from Moscow.
Now, who's it gonna be?
Last we saw each other, we were on opposite sides of a courtroom.
We've received more death threats.
No I trust my master so much...
OK, Art, what do you want to talk about?
Finish your drink, then I'm putting you on a bus back home.
I'll decide on a dismissal in seven days.
Your cooperation has been invaluable.
Where am I supposed to go, Ray?
She got the DA to reopen the murder investigation.
Well, I should know by the end of the week.
Well, surely, some of you think I should.
Not in the office.
This is gonna stay around my neck.
You think you could find out how she's doing?
You always mean well.
But you'll know what it means.
Pine is soft and weak.
That company meant everything to me.
I understand the King has made you Earl of Hertford.
The finest brain I ever had the pleasure to teach.
This is a lie.
We're going to have a significant influx of capital very soon, and we'll make up the merger deficit.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Frank Underwood!
- He just lost eight soldiers.
You know,she was born in the U.K., came to the States to go to Princeton,graduated Yale Law.
No, no.
- Your majesty.
Think about it, Senator.
You confirmed it?
I had two daughters also.
Tommy, I miss anything?
As soon as you need. That's not a problem.
Only contact us on this.
- I am not so conceited as to suppose I am anything more to His Majesty than a diligent servant.
It was nice working with you.
I've been sleeping with him.
It no longer interests me.
Lot of traveling.
Oh, it was so nice to see him.
You get what?
When Patty's done putting on her case, it's my turn.
You know, your skin would stick to the seats in the summer.
I don't care that you met with her, I just want to know why you didn't tell me about it.
And it is an honor to have you both visiting.
And I keep the third document.
- Patty.
I'm sorry.
I can't take any more of it.
Well, if it is, that means he's still alive.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Good to see you, Marshall.
I'm sorry to disturb your prayers.
I seen you on TV defending that family.
I'm, I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?
Kendrick and his company Ultima National Resources have systematically ravaged the environment.
Three wounded, one KlA.
I'm just trying to educate you.
But I tell you this I fully intend to use it.
And what happened to Greg?
They met twice.
Mi preciosa.
Who cares what he thinks?
Well, so, choose a day next week, and let's be done with it.
Patty Hewes knows about Arlington.
Erica, go inside.
He worries for the King's health, in body and in mind.
Look, there's something here that you really got to see.
I'm so sorry to interrupt your dinner.
- Your Grace.
It is I myself who bare all responsibility, for my conscience, which troubles and doubts me.
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure" "and wisely, temperately, like myself," "not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman," "but to thank God of all,"
Unfreeze my assets.
I'll write you a check.
This is very intriguing, but we are gonna need something more concrete.
It's been 68 hours.
I have no idea what the truth is.
Okay, we're done here.
We've come here, so you can listen to and talk to this good man, Mr. Robert Aske.
Fuck the line!
We'll deal with it on Monday morning.
You promised to protect Katie.
And then she will love you.
How's Saturday?
Our goal is to make you financially whole again.
You will see them there.
Did you mother tell you what happened the second time they met?
Where's the rest of it?
Holding onto that table like it's a stripper's tits. Harlan.
Is that all you know about her?
- What's up?
You need to meet this head-on.
Bar's closed.
This is my first real lead.
I did not know about these things before but... but it has been brought to light by learned opinion.
What's your secret?
Hiding their crimes,huh?
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.
I would wish that we were both over the sea.
Call Ellen Parsons.
See, to me, you are the hero of this story.
Here's a woman who describes her vows as a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge. And a man who wears his wedding ring as a badge of shame, for the debutante deserved more.
Take this.
Yes, I'm here waiting.
I wanted to talk to you about the McClaren case.
Since I was the most deceived.
Well, isn't this a swell picture.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to include the duke of suffolk in our plans.
He's trying to make the case go away before it closes in on him.
Form up your men!
And my paralyzing fear of death. Right.
- Some, but not enough.
He doesn't know I saw him.
Should I arrange...?
Their results are clean.
Why do you say?
How're you doing?
"When Congress refused to support a peacekeeping mission in the Jordan Valley, the president deployed troops anyway, stating his authority as Commander in Chief."
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force her to reveal things she doesn't want to.
From day one, you've been insulated.
You don't want to be a father, Michael.
- In this realm, there should be perfect love.
How old is megan now?
- So it's true?
I just came by to grab some stuff. I thought it would be better when no one was around.
They mean nothing to me.
I have heard that your own servants are much involved in the violence, Mr. Secretary.
And educative.
Get her out of the country.
That is what his grace wants to talk to you about.
What's the name of this new guy?
We appeared on a panel together once.
You're very clever.
Have you had any dreams this week?
I need three, at least.
We gave our money to Leverett and Leverett gave it to Tobin.
You and Lenny.
My mistake.
Who's your supplier?
Someone called him a half dozen times
- Mr. Cromwell.
20 years ago, he was arrested for using neighborhood kids to run a numbers racket.
I'm not.
- I'll let you go.
No, wrong move, Tom.
They need it in stone, Francis, that we'll contribute troops.
-Monsieur Ambassadeur...
In my professional opinion, yes.
And even if there was a journal... you don't have it in you.
I didn't have anything to do with any of this.
I couldn't take it anymore-- the yelling, the screaming.
- From the other night?.
That name has got to be in there somewhere.
This is America, for Christ's sake.
And that was the last time you were in touch with Michael?
I didn't want the D.A. to get to Carol, so I put her here.
I let myself in.
I want you to look at me.
Also, my lord privy seal, my lord chancellor...
AND TO MAKE ME HAPPY.
Mr. Cromwell...
As we discovered in germany and what do you expect me to do?
- The sexist comment?
We tried to reach out, but he won't talk without his attorney present.
Christopher Sanchez.
You don't know the whole story.
I don't know.
Does she really want that aired in open court?
- Nothing.
How could we know the woman would leak her own sex life?
In which case... we are no longer obliged to deliver our side of the bargain.
You've never respected Mom.
These are mountains.
Since when did you start smoking?
Oh, yes!
I know what I did.
How is Queen Katherine?
I'll do whatever you need me to.
The stakes have grown higher.
You play very well, Mr. Leigh.
The King sent it to me this morning.
It's still a few years away from production, though.
Don't you think this is pouring it on a bit thick?
I rented it with some friends.
- Your Majesty.
How did this get in here?
Oh, my God.
You can do as you will.
There is another reason why the King's humor is improved. There are rumors.
So... if I give you this number, I want something in return.
Go to church.
Well, the book isn't really about The Sentinel, so I don't know why he'd bother, but I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.
The Lord is good.
It'll just be a few days.
It's your choice.
Arthur needs me.
A chief executive's job is to set his company's agenda.
That folder will speak louder than anything I could say.
He approached Ellen alone, that's the way he wants it.
You have to come back.
Come, ladies.
Sorry, man, I just don't buy it.
Take McClaren as a client.
He will be made an earl and be given estates.
- You, too.
Didn't you cater some event for him?
Katie Connor?
I don't think that you're going far enough, or fast enough.
We already have.
I don't see why not.
I have to go.
This site was******* "Every man deserves the best."
Glad to hear it.
This kind of thing could get me disbarred.
- Excuse me?!
Yes, of course.
If I'm gonna invite you to cabinet meetings, there's not gonna be any kid gloves.
I hope Your Majesty is not too disappointed?
And you're right, mom, you will.
He met with you alone?
I am not going to let your young friend sit across a table from Patty Hewes and face an inquisition.
And since His Majesty confirms that you are still a maid, you are free to marry whom you choose.
- Of course not.
How do you know he's not bluffing?
Joan! Why? Why must I stay here?
And it is increasingly difficult for us to exchange letters.
Thinks you may be in over your head.
You really don't have to explain the situation.
- That would suit Katherine!
- What you need is sleep.
I'm okay. I just want to talk.
If you don't hand it over, I'll have you thrown in jail for contempt.
There is only one way to reach the king's ear, and that is through the good offices of cardinal wolsey.
- You think you know a story.
We monitored the room from check-in to check-out.
For now.
Just... Being in that bathroom...
Enough of this shit.
Where are you gonna find another plaintiff?
The guy bankrupted 5,000 of his employees.
- I hear your master has signed a separate treaty with the French.
Extraordinarily stupid idea.
An Imperial wedding.
We have enough evidence to draw up this draft indictment.
Oh, it's not just that, Mr. Rich.
Okay, can you hold it?
Do you believe that High Star tortured the men that they took?
She's upset.
I read your college essay.
In fact, formally, I am a guest of the Constable, who just brought you here.
He told Dunbar about me.
It seems he is also tiring of your sister.
They're trying to kill me.
I run tests and I analyze the results.
Do you remember?
It's Jack Benny.
And I can work with the political team, coordinate with House leg directors, chiefs of staff--
I am re-born!
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Mine broke during the arrest.
Louis Tobin's boots, Danielle Marchetti's phone.
How can I help you, Arthur?
I want to be president one day.
Oh, the Poles have an agenda.
I got to go.
With regards to...?
Well, get them in here.
I have no idea.
Does our Lord not commend us to never to let mercy and faithfulness depart from us?
Getting out from under my shadow was the best thing that could ever happen to you.
But I think maybe they be no clients.
- I'm reading her e-mails. I'm tracking her phone.
This is not a good time.
And it weighs down my conscience.
Yes, father.
For your prosperity and health I prefer and desire more than my own.
I need you to be honest with me.
Oh. How's the girl?
A guy like McClaren would have no problem hacking in.
The edict instructs your majesty to order lady anne boleyn to leave your court.
You know, it was another time.
You got three of my men killed carrying out your personal business.
Do you regret what we did?
That's bullshit.
How's Maine?
Oh, yes, we are.
I'd do it again.
He needs discipline, okay?
My sister's coming from Oregon.
Ooh, the 13 year olds will be riveted.
How are you feeling now?
Hello, Heather.
Good to see you.
Dean Gulickson from the Times called again.
If you want this, claire, it's yours.
You believe that we're equals?
Not at Quiznos, we didn't.
Maybe not, but...
- Monique bryant.
A little, sure.
They will be fishing.
So, uh, we have some distance to bridge here.
I beg of you.
I've lost track.
Oh, don't worry about me; I can handle myself.
I need you to testify.
And you got Jay Rayburn here.
I'll be gone for a while.
McCLAREN: I'm, I'm not saying that she lied.
- What about it?
As a party to this litigation, I can understand why I'm in your crosshairs.
We see the, um, Frobisher trial as a epic tale of rebirth.
Your Majesty...
Cardinal wolsey!
As for his tribe, I'd say Kom Nuristani.
Has the King sent you?
He must know more than he's telling me.
If you don't want to, you don't have to do this.
I have long noticed your aptitude for work and your diligence in carrying through my affairs.
Hello. Ellen Parsons.
You know, the only time I saw Frobisher was with you.
I want my daughter to know... who I am.
They say that some day You're gonna be the King of England.
It's all you got.
I have no idea.
You're under arrest.
Sir Henry Norris has come courting.
God be with all of you!
Nope-- ten years in prison; 250 large in fines.
HEWES: Come on up.
- Why now, Holly?
Your majesty.
The marriage was his idea.
- I know exactly why I did.
Who is the President of the United States?
Mr. Cromwell tells me that the king now dines with norfolk and boleyn.
They must utterly renounce them and swear to be our true and faithful subjects.
You will talk to Chapuys.
Tell me, Monsieur Marillac: what did your King really say when you told him His Majesty had got rid of his last Queen?
Thank you, son.
Except Julia Stamper passed away ten years ago.
Well, if she wanted confirmation that High Star was running a program like that, how would she get it?
But not a son.
Whe... When I was a young priest in Germany, my family's house was occupied by Lutheran mercenaries.
What's it gonna be, Pete?
Always,be assured of our love.
No, no, I don't.
Hello, David. Patty.
I'm aware of nothing.
It feels like a betrayal to even talk to you.
Well,how did you two meet?
He wants patty hewes taken down as badly as we do.
Kendrick is intermittently shutting down power plants, limiting supply to drive up prices.
The duke of orleans is very glad to be betrothed to princess mary.
She belongs to the King- and don't you forget it.
Watch me.
This is Agent Werner.
- Poor Henry... - No.
- After you hired him!
It really is you.
George Moore.
Almost every day.
What do you want?
I could get you a lot more.
Maybe thousands.
I'll see you in the morning.
He'd like to include you in his will.
All right, gentlemen.
I had drinks with mitch mccullen.
I said, come in!
I know what you mean.
But intent is everything.
What shall I say to him?
I beg you.
Darcy and York have betrayed me?
They just keep driving, because success is what makes them feel good about themselves.
God be with you.
-I condemn them utterly.
You try to contact her, you die.
- No, I'm good.
They're doing some work at my building.
Tell me.
Now, in Louis's case, I think heart attack would be the more
I wonder if Your Majesty could frame your mind towards a new marriage.
It's good, it's, uh... it's great, actually.
- We still have months to go.
An incorrigible heretic called John Lambert is now imprisoned in The Tower and likely soon to be burned.
Do yourself a favor, Ellen, don't have kids.
They told me you were like to die... but you won't die.
- On which hand?
When Lenny first started working for him- when Daddy brought you home for the first time - I remember he said to me,
Well, in the past year and a half, your father purchased $14,000 worth of clothes for miss Marchetti.
- The kitchen.
- Channing, we were just...
You must never ask to see me again.
As long as it doesn't interfere with...
He made it very clear that he doesn't want me in his life.
No, it's not good, Patty.
You know, I sometimes wish that all spaniards were at the bottom of the sea!
Now this is the police report from the accident.
Tuck you in and get you all cozy.
Katie, don't, don't.
Mainly 'cause, uh, I don't have to.
You withheld evidence, Patty.
- In my wallet.
I thought it was time you met her properly.
This is her.
- What do you want?
I shouldn't have interrupted you earlier.
I presume you have told her about her father, is she alright
Is that so?
- Gregory who?
I hate sneaking around like this.
She preferred the, uh... what hotel was the, uh...?
Majesty, I...
We got ourselves a situation here.
Well, can you try to find out?
You know, a lot of guys your age, they- they just don't have character yet.
No, I just- I thought...
Hey, are you following me?
I am not gonna let anyone connect that to us, do you understand?
But I promise you, as soon as this case is done, I'm gonna take everyone on a real vacation,oka
You shared your life with him for over 40 years, and yet you didn't know that he was stealing? Actually, I...
And what was the nature of this business?
Please, God, don't take her away from me.
Should you have anything to discuss, you may do so with my chamberlain.
We're seriously looking into that possibility, yes.
You are a poet,as I am a woman.
That's fantastic!
Thank you, Ambassador.
We just want to keep playing.
And did you give him the codes?
She's abnormally tired.
When does he want to meet?
Who's behind this, Daniel?
Have you read it?
Of course I know.
I said,you're to be released.
Along with passwords to our faculty's personal e-mail accounts.
Did you not find anything to eat?
He is in a war zone.
Now you have a chance to set things right.
- What is it?
I'm waiting for you in my office.
It's only a suggestion.
It's only because of this one right here.
Have you made your intentions plain to Miss Sheldon, Sir Henry?
The King detests him above all men.
I've had his name taken off the police report, but we have to take care of the girl.
- And we are both officially at war with the emperor.
I can't wait for this summit!
You are not my chancellor.
Your Grace.
Just when I started sleeping better, now you're up and down all night.
What things?
- Is it time?
Did you find her?
It was a bad idea to put all your eggs in one basket.
I'm a christian man, the child of everlasting joy, through the merits of the bitter passion of christ.
No, I'm not.
He has respect for his job.
- An executive order.
What have they told you about the King?
It's not good.
And of course, no one will be happier than His Holiness if we should commit ourselves to reconquer the Holy Land.
A testament to your faith.
Discovery request.
- Ellen, look at me.
KNEW him, many years ago, at Cambridge.
Now, I must insist you stay to enjoy the dancing.
- What?
This money's mine.
Sir, have you given any thought to simply signing the bill that Congress passed last night?
It is not my place to say this, Madam, but... perhaps we know each other well enough.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
I had to come back.
We have to find out what that is.
Either way, you don't want to pursue them.
Her check-up seemed okay.
I've got to get some work done on the deposition.
You're kidding.
I didn't hit him once?
There's always a place for you at Hewes & Shayes.
- Your Majesty is entering the third period of your natural life.
- Have a good evening.
I made you a promise.
The last four words.
It's okay, Ms. Parsons. Ms. Hewes hired security for you.
The hotel guest that was staying in the room next to Channing and Naomi. McCLAREN:
Robert, there was a time when nothing was more sure than a promise of a prince, but now we think these promises nothing but a policy to blind the people.
- Well, that was the risk.
Because you're more important than work.
The duke of Suffolk came to tell her that the king has married...
But she'll never be able to.
We need to find him.
I let him know we were hopeful.
It's biology, Ellen.
Triumph in Scotland, perhaps?
Well, this won't take very long.
- I heard you.
You don't want us pursuing it.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
Get some minions.
He will be known for the present as henry fitzroy.
No, I want you to keep playing Patty Hewes.
I'm telling you now.
It's not for me to say.
That's all.
- Katherine Howard!
Everything that's happened to you...
I'm sorry about that.
There's no way she...
Is she feeling threatened?
Arm yourself!
- However, Campeggio tells me that the Pope is prepared to consider legitimizing any children that you might have with Mistress Boleyn, whether you are married or not.
Go play with your cousins, ally.
Oh. The name you gave Tom turned out to be significant.
- S.EC files?
Do you want me to act now? No.
My stepfather.
That is not the ending.
Something must be terribly wrong with Carol.
I can get you all the documentation.
Pray God they catch him!
If not you, then who?
- you never even told me she was sick.
There's no point in protecting your father anymore.
This is the last time you'll ever set foot in this office.
Well, I find that very hard to believe.
If one of us is a peasant, I think it's me.
Was she with one of her regulars?
Things are not well between us.
I'm sorry.
I want you to tell all of this to the police, exactly what you told me, about the carjacking and the man.
Have a good time at your folks.
A father must always seek for ways to forgive his children, but Henry's crimes against us and against our faith are too profound to forgive.
- Yes, but- one fine morning you'll succumb to her reasoning and cast me off!
Herreshoff had the commission open a file on Fund 23 about a year ago.
- We all pray for the King's life and his success.
Patty was at the beach house.
They need whatever they can get, and they need it now.
They also tell me he has struck up an acquaintance with the Imperial Ambassador, Chapuys.
And if you're knowingly taking the fall for somebody else then you're breaking the law.
I'm buried right now.
I haven't, uh... seen Jim in a while.
Katherine's daughter?
- Kicking ass, mainly.
I knew we were extracting human targets for interrogation.
What would be your assessment of us so far?
Walt, our stock won't recover until Patty retracts her statements.
Previously asked and answered.
I want you to drink this, Chris.
Seriously, is there something wrong with you?
I'm in trouble.
Mr. President, are you aware, sir, that campaigning on Air Force One
You're having second thoughts about giving the guest sermon?
Lady Katherine is a very proud stubborn woman of very great and high courage.
You got to the office early.
That's a separate issue.
Yeah, hey, the meeting went great.
I believe we're finished with that subject now.
He threw it at her.
You're gonna drop this lawsuit.
You want to be successful and nice.
The case is over if we don't go through with this.
So Tobin could have buried his accounts?
I, uh, screwed up.
For your protection.
Thanks for going to meet with him.
I'm an attorney... who knows that if a hooker gets a corporate litigator to defend her on cocaine charges, it ain't because she's a good lay.
Here is a report of a sermon recently given in cambridge by a certain hugh latimer a senior member of the university.
Israel's back on board again, Alexi, so the moment you sell arms to Iran, we will shoot the planes out of the sky, the trucks off the road, and the ships out of the water.
'Cause I have a minibar.
I'm not good for my guys like this.
You have very important information.
We agreed on a price, but if she wants to renegotiate...
I'm halfway done.
I understand, your honor.
I am no whore... your majesty.
All right, yeah, tell you what I'll do.
But you're the lawyer, Ellen, tell me what to do.
Oh, we're just talking here, but I think 150... would probably get you a deal.
I'm taking the boys to choir practice.
You'll work in pairs.
You must be Marilyn Tobin.
Everything is going to be all right.
Can you not agree, was it rather spreading fauls foolingness* for example,the parish churches we're going to put down which actully caused rebellion
My buddy-- he's got a cabin upstate.
I think she lives here.
It's not 'cause you're bad. It's just, you did something wrong.
I must see the King.
You are leaving me.
I don't know.
If we wait, he's just going to cover his tracks.
You can do that.
Well, I appreciate your opinion.
There is also a statute before parliament which recognizes that, in matters, temporal and spiritual, the king is above the law and shall give account to god alone!
Either way, we have to plan our next move.
I'm too old to begin now.
- Yeah, let's, uh, sit down there.
I've made alterations to wolsey's old palace at york place.
I want you to know that.
Previously on Damages...
Get in there and see if you can id him.
I tried to get her to back off, but I think she needs a bigger incentive.
I've seen the blight of drugs.
I... I know you're not supposed to do this with water, but...
I saw the same thing you did.
But right now, I need to focus on making things right.
Ah, as you know, my family finances are a mess.
Are you okay?
And you deserve better than being an also-ran.
Conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.
Do you really think we should go to war?
She will lose everything, won't she?
I haven't though about it.
If I'm going to find your friend Sanchez, I need to know there's actually a story worth writing about.
- Majesty, forgive me.
The Valor Ecclesiasticus: the results of the Commissioner's investigations into the wealth and practices of all the religious houses in Your Majesty's kingdom.
My friend. - The one who died.
Then why should I?
I do not know who it is that wants man dead.
Jesus, Patty, you think I want to be here?
I've made up my mind, Ms. Hewes.
It's a long shot. Worth a try.
And people are scared, which is why you want this to go away quickly.
How did you get in?
I demand that your majesty banish him from court with whatever other punishment your majesty sees fit.
Not at the moment.
You know, to be honest, I listened to your message maybe five times trying to figure out whether you were bringing me back for good news or bad news.
You're wasting your talents.
Why is Patty Hewes tampering with our investigation?
I,um,I understand that your mother passed away recently.
So we need to attack her.
You could say that.
What else was I supposed to do?
Who's your client?
That won't matter.
I almost envy you the opportunity.
That dude?
A cider-braised pork shoulder.
People get killed all the time, danny.
What's happened?
Why do you appear to me?
You shouldn't either.
His death is the only military KlA reported on October eighteenth.
Mr. Cromwell!
Trust me.
I swear.
- I have a new motto.
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question to you.
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million so they'd introduce the poison pill amendment.
I want to know!
And then, in the same place, they brought a pony with an ape on his back!
No, your Majesty.
- He did have a choice.
You think you made me. No, I don't.
You leave at once for Boulogne.
I want to sue her.
He finds that he is... reconciled to your condition.
This morning's paper.
Let's do it.
Comme çI... comme ça!
Lately most of our lands have been sold off and my family is gradually reduced to poverty.
No, of course not. We're just trying to make sure that Ms. Walling's assailant doesn't go unpunished.
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com www.tvsubtitles.net
Just please... call me back, okay? www.tvsubtitles.net
- Okay.
Because Kendrick makes money.
They're gone, Chris.
I thought you want everyone to think I was fired.
They'll be a press conference later today.
I thought you should know that Gerald Boorman met with me regarding the case against High Star.
I hate that feeling.
You of all people should understand after what they did to Katie.
You and your CEO friend are going to be neck-deep in shit.
Who's the box from?
GO GET MY FATHER!
What remedy, Mr. Cromwell?
I'm dyslexic.
Your Majesty.
Thomas Lowry.
And it's not a dump site. It's a dumpster.
- I didn't say that.
They're gonna try to make Patty Hewes the villain.
We do not have time to be afraid, my friends.
Do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
The court is for more ambitious men.
I'm counting on you, Jack.
All of the firm's resources will be at your disposal.
I was elected earlier this year.
But maybe I can stop it from getting worse. RACHEL:
He was in tears after leaving Your Majesty's presence.
I'd love to see Megan get in.
Is everything okay?
That's why I asked you to speak.
The woman has the sharpes bullshit meter I've ever seen.
- Then his honor.
It is, indeed.
I'm fine.
Let's go show 'em what we got.
In the case of the Princefield systems, you mentioned the attacker would have to have an additional authentication factor?
Trust me.
I don't know how you're going to choose your next case.
Fuck it. This is it, man.
Yeah. I can't change it.
Sir Thomas, how good of you to come.
I'd like to change course to the America Works program.
I want rec centers and town halls, but the most important thing is schools.
I have important things to say.
Look, there's something here that you really got to see.
Whou! I am sure you are aware, Sir John, that my marriage has been declared null and void.
What did Detective Messer tell you?
Don't you ever get any ideas into that mind of yours.
From now on, you do what I say or you're gone.
What? What do you believe a High Star employee would do if he located the type of man that you're referring to?
Never again.
With two large houses upon it?
We understand that the Dauphin, and an army of over 36,000 men are preparing to march on Boulogne.
You watch what you say.
Yes, I understand.
You need to get her to a hospital.
This is going to destroy Tom's career.
I have a few things I gotta run over with Claire.
You come out against me and America Works and you steal Dunbar's thunder.
Why are you asking me?
Richard Leland.
In the meantime, figure out what you want to do.
I was going to call you.
I'm sure you got a briefing from the FBl.
And I don't want to suggest your name to Jacobs unless you truly want the position.
Your Majesty?
Mr. Simon, would you look over this, please.
Sorry I'm late, Judge. The three train must have been stuck in molasses.
Listen, you can come up and sit up front if you like.
I understand it was quite a nasty car accident.
Maybe he's not too happy with his own job.
Were you having an affair?
He gave me some information.
Move aside!
I think if we don't get away, I may lose you forever.
- I humiliated myself.
Making you desperate, backing you into a corner.
Don't trust no one... www.Team-NClS.com www.sub-way.fr www.tvsubtitles.net
In this world, majesty, a true and loyal friend is the greatest boon any man can have.
It's never a "yes" until they actually make the payoff.
Mr. Erickson, can you identify the person in this photograph?
- Yes. And the only mourners at his funeral were the ghosts of his children.
Bye. NAOMl:
Boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?
- In Italy.
What the king ordered!
He wants to visit you privately.
He said that he gave people the Bible to read, but not so that they could dispute its meanings.
Do you believe her denial?
You're not gonna show your face, no?
She's beating the tom-toms.
It's just his screen name; I don't know how that will help.
You're a number two, Tom.
Did you honestly think that he could handle that?
Do you have any idea what it might be?
Yeah, of course it is.
Some of them, even now, are very close to the King.
I have been encouraging your supporters in parliament, and elsewhere, to speak their minds - and stand up for you.
You're not a battered wife defending her abusive husband to the end, huh? Oh, geez.
I have to run this country and win a nomination.
Why you gave me this?
She still has to hand over a list of his donors.
I have consulted widely to discover the truth and I have read in Leviticus that it was against God's law, and a sin, for me to marry my brother's wife.
You know that.
Your Majesty, the Emperor has put forward Christina, His niece, the Duchess of Milan.
Though Your Majesty is still a young man, you are not as young as used to be.
But that could very well change.
But, your wedding is coming up, isn't it?
What is it?
So do it.
You're lucky I've been keeping an eye on her.
Thirty-two thousand feet, one minute to insert.
Ever since I got out of the hospital, I've sought the counsel of a spiritual advisor.
You like being an attorney?
- Did he agree to that?
We have to talk. Tom?
We are not talking about your ex-girlfriend. We're talking about my running mate.
It's "all systems go" for your restaurant.
I'm worried about Chris Sanchez.
You stay the hell away from my family!
Not necessary.
Is it gonna be a while?
Kevin walker was identified in a lineup,and then he confessed to the murder.
When would you like this to happen?
Your Majesty.
Don't be stupid.
What does Patty Hewes know?
- Daniel,no!
- What?
It has great strategic importance.
Do you trust him?
Stop, stop it, just stop.
He's worried that you'll pick up the cause, pursue High Star without me.
May I present you to Her Majesty Queen Jane?
Who doesn't want Marilyn Tobin to go to Africa?
You and phil are getting a divorce.
- Good to see you again.
Just feeling a little warm.
For the fireworks?
It turns out that Frobisher was going to meet with some guy from the government.
I would rather not trouble the Sheriff.
You're going to North at once.
You lied to me, pretending to be on my side!
We won't ever see each other again?
That's the fun of it.
Ah, you must be pretty special if you were Patty's favorite.
Then you know that I didn't give her anything, and I just got up and I walked away.
- Merry Christmas.
So your mother told you she voluntarily sought out
Thomas tallis!
You know, the less I know about Your husband, the more He fascinates me.
I have done nothing wrong or against the King's Majesty.
I hate you!
Israel won't back us unless we commit troops.
Just picture her naked body, those breasts, those thighs that sweet little arse.
- Mom, when did you get a job?
Am I right?
I'm sorry to hear that.
- Omnia vincit amor:E"no one can resist love."
Maybe if settle you might... you might start sleeping better. (laughs) PARSONS:
Then patty hewes starts looking into you.
Your Majesty.
What would you do?
I've given myself entirely into the hands of god, and I know with certainty that when I die I shall pass into a far better place than this.
No. This is the only one we picked up.
Torben and Herreshoff are very dangerous men.
I don't want you to resent me.
A certain level?
And don't bother coming back.
I I hear that several of your agents have been sent abroad to canvas theological opinion about the divorce. For every scholar that votes for you,
It's not even loaded.
I fired him.
I have a son!
You will order our troops on the border to retaliate, with spoils, burnings and killings.
There needs to be more oversight.
She is so clever.
What if you don't?
I feel so sorry for you.
You don't care about Robert.
Nothing, she just asked if you tried to hire me.
Who got busted?
You're the only person I could think of to talk to.
It gives me much pleasure to invite you and the Duchess to dine with us while we are in Calais.
We have asked that the heretics, bishops and temporal, be punished.
What kind of mistake?
Ellen Parsons.
Well, in the end, you had my back.
If anyone knows how to hide money, it's you. What am I, your
I do not know who to say this to, Mr.. Culpepper.
She's good in every way, Majesty.
- Go fetch a physician.
Out of the money the King pays for her household.
Looked like he'd been in a fight.
F train to Queens.
But the bank has everything about me on file.
We asked for a list of all of McClaren's donors.
You looked very sad, my Lady.
What do you mean, she knows things?
I guess I'm more the drama type.
More soon.
finds your grace... guilty of the charges against you.
Sometimes it was just sex. But a lot of times, it wasn't.
Martin Cutler extended himself.
Find out more.
You know how it works.
$80 a hit.
Mom, listen to me. Carrie has never had a chance.
If you don't mind, I want to run something by you.
Why will you not swear?
He thought it might be nice for the two of you to hang out while I'm gone.
I'm Terry Brooke.
Karl, we can't thank you enough.
- Let's go before Patty Hewes finds out.
You're wasting your time.
Do I, Larry?
I trust that's the last time you'll ask me about a former employee.
Ms. Parsons?
- Sir Ralph.
Oh, Jesus, Patty, come on.
What was the cause of the quarrel?
Corey, come here, boy.
Remember me by this.
The sisters of the Duke of Cleves.
I had made Fisher a Prince of the Church... but it mattered nothing to King Henry, who is now so mired in vice and lust that he is beyond reason.
Thank you.
Oh, shoot.
Okay, you know what?
- That guy...
Presumed, to send a message to me.
If you once let down your guard, the Devil will slip, like a serpent, into your mouth.
If you could read Greek, Master Smeaton, you'd know that even the gods had problems with their wives!
-I said I will speak with you when you are well.
You're good to go.
I love what you say about law school versus the real world.
Not with us!
As your accountant, I have to advise against it.
I should ask you the same question.
Most likely, she'll grill you on precedents for our current case, but any topic is fair game... constitutional law, torts, contracts.
Well, at the moment, you're our only source of funding.
A butcher's son?!
What is it used for?
I'm making a fool of myself?
We have to shut her up.???
Jesus Christ!
I was told his body is still hanging, Trimmed in chains, for all to see.
You're the last male Hewes.
- Oh, sure. I'm so sorry.
You miss your daddy, don't you?
Extraordinary rendition, ClA, innocent man being framed as a terrorist.
I'm sure His Majesty would be overjoyed if she produced a Duke of York.
And how did her personal information get included?
I've been looking into Patty's history.
The car is gone.
Now, you forget about her. HEWES:
Because we're in bed with Torben.
Do you think that's because I'm a water sign?
They don't like to be dragged anywhere.
I am very proud of her.
Just what we wanted.
And I send you to prison for life.
One moment.
So you keep that for yourself and, uh... get rid of her.
You're just open to considering him.
- Why don't we take a photo first?
August 19th.
And, and, look, I-I thought this might help you.
Well, Andrew's capable, and, Felicia.
Look, Mr. Frobisher, you're insulated, you have resources.
Yeah, I'd agree.
I told you.
I asked him to come, and he's right, it won't matter.
How long has it been going on, Danielle, hmm?
And I tried to be fair with them, didn't I?
So I had Louis pay her to make the baby go away.
Francis and I so appreciate you all coming out here on such a cold day and welcoming us with such warmth!
He was a fine man, an even better mentor.
So I am told.
She's disappeared like this before.
He wanted to do his part for the war effort.
I picked it because it bends well.
Darling Anne, you're safe.
You're gonna have to wait.
Of course I know who you are.
No, please!
And with or without your support.
About a year ago, Jill, I made a decision.
Intense concentration.
You sure as hell can.
My wife will wonder where i went.
My lords, I do confess to you that, although I have lain with the Queen almost every night these past weeks, my conscience will not permit me to consummate this marriage because I feel there is some impediment to it.
Everyone's got dirty laundry.
What do you have?
Is he with you now?
To prove that the commons will fight in Christ cause.
Help me.
I want the people to love their new queen as I love her.
And I want to see Sanchez.
You look fantastic.
Never heard of him.
Then I am truly honoured.
You and I, we meet at some boring luncheon down in Florida, and the next thing you know, we're-we're partners.
This was hand-delivered.
We'll call a meeting, then decide.
And some others may be of a mind that if they say one thing, but think another, then their oath goes upon what they think and not upon what they say.
- And you believed him?
Forgive me, ambassador, for receiving you here.
Are you sure?
She treats you like dirt for ten years, won't share the spotlight, then she refuses make you a partner.
Gather round.
Well, I appreciate him taking time out of his schedule to come by.
But let me show you something.
Especially, as it is said, that you're a peace-maker who'll be continually trying to persuade his majesty to restore his daughter Mary to favor.
He's entitled to a speedy trial, access to counsel.
That it's a boy.
Tell my girls I died easily, and with no pain.
- He did this as a warning to you.
About what?
And then, then what happens?
Who are you?
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.
So he claims.
I mean, if you wrote that, no one would believe it.
I've got to pass on that.
That can't be easy.
Did you find anything? Um, yeah.
What's that?
She's not used to seeing me more than two days in a row.
Do not be facetious, Fool. Did you know...
And my child?
What happened?
After all, I am supposed to be concerned with that.
But you do not have to suffer anything.
Once the sickness in your country abates, he will travel to england and, together with cardinal wolsey, constitute a court to hear and decide upon the merits of the case.
Gregory, just give me a name, okay?
He will be supported by my Lord Chancellor Risley and Archbishop Cranmer.
So far neither of us has done anything illegal.
Don't be stupid.
If High Star was running some sort of terrorist extraction program, they couldn't have done it alone.
Channing... If she calls the police, if you get arrested...
You should thank Chris.
What do you mean by that?
And speaking of the disagreements in this room, we now have an even bigger one, because Remy has shown me your work so far and... it's toothless.
Even before bawds and pimps.
Just got to tell my wife that we've lost everything.
I have no friend here and little counsel.
Heading out?
With all due respect, that's bullshit.
Guys, come here.
I can't.
What is it?
I shot my first gun when I was eight.
You need to say no more.
- To the job.
His majesty thought you might like to wear it.
I hope you'll convey our dissatisfaction directly to your husband.
For one stroke?
Well... what happens if she flies?
Yeah, but he has the same loss of appetite, no energy.
What the hell you doing?
How is the king?
Could a meeting have occurred at some other time?
Mr. Tobin, are you there?
I beg you to restore - and keep the abbeys.
I need him back.
Let's talk more about that swim.
When others fall by the wayside, through vanity,avarice or lust... you remain loyal to us, and to the truth of Christ.
Oh, god! you are a Bad boy!
Did you do it?
He's been wearing it on his sleeve for years.
Thank you, Captain.
- Madam, we are not here to discuss a brief, or any such.
You're gorgeous.
Katie brought you a videotape that Gregory Malina made.
Get it back.
Can I talk to her?
Hmph! Everyone has an agenda!
To get to High Star.
- Good to see you.
His behavior gets... incredibly erratic.
Didn't he have to take drug tests?
Eminence,lady blount is here.
Not since she went back home.
I have a gift for you.
We're in escrow on this property here.
I have to admit, I miss it a little.
Happy to take your money anytime or place.
I must be honest with Your Grace, you had been accused of too great of leniency towards the rebels,towards recalcitrant monks and other upholders of the old religion, it... it is disreputed whether you are in your heart and soul fully engaged in struggle against the treasons, rebels or Wheather you are in your heart still papist
Details of your life are going to come out.
And they stay out here.
Someone I haven't heard from in a long time.
I had a thought.
I don't give a shit about the mink.
Two knaves...
For some seasons, I desire quails eggs above anything else.
But sir,pase,on't come back to the bank.
Yes, I'm sure.
Since he loves your majesty I am certain he will rule in your favour.
She got you for a week.
This is a big night for you, huh?
No, I've moved on.
I'm going to leave it in our hiding place, okay?
- Now you be careful.
And feel free to use any and all of our resources.
And through him, you serve others.
Carter has Sanchez locked down.
You can have a week, Patty, but you better show me something concrete.
Yeah, what's that?
I'm sorry to hear that.
We decided to talk on the record.
- And I thought someone said she was an intelligent woman. - Ah!
Show me out, please.
And she spends the night.
Ma'am, at this moment, he's being interviewed by federal agents.
I didn't know Naomi Walling.
Long before you were Arthur's teacher... he sought my guidance.
Since I have you here, Channing, I need your help with something.
Don't you?
At the bank,I could see you have an interest in her.
Why don't you begin with Rome.
You were responsible for knowing everything that happened on the ground over there.
Well, it's time for you to take lead.
- And do you believe any of it to be true?
I have one quick question about a recent transaction.
