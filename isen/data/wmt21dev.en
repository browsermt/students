Biden ahead in polls in three key states
Only 100 days before the election, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has a lead in three important swing states.
According to CNN today, Biden is ahead in Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured at 51% compared to 46% support for the President.
In Arizona, the numbers are 49%-45% for Biden, and Michigan is heading for a major Biden victory, as he has a 12 percent lead there, 52%-40%.
In order to win the election in November, in 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states and must in fact do more than that.
These days, Trump has to deal with a coronavirus pandemic for which more and more Americans blame him, with the vast majority of people polled saying that the federal government responded poorly or very poorly at the start of the pandemic.
In addition, Trump has fared extremely poorly in relation to the protests and riots following George Floyd's death.
Trump and his government are believed to have responded poorly or incorrectly to these issues.
Yet another addition to Trump's problems is the serious criticism he now faces for ordering federal troops to quell protests in cities where the mayor or governor is a Democrat.
This has created enormous hostility among the residents of these cities, and this anger has spread to Americans elsewhere.
Nor have photographs of federal agents pulling protesters into unmarked cars helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project's advertisement, which can be seen below, highlighted this.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very narrow margin of votes.
In fact, Trump won many states with a narrow margin and won the elections with a minority of votes.
He won Michigan, for example, with only 10,704 votes.
That is less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all polls taken seriously by political analysts show the same results: Biden has taken the lead.
CNN's new poll in Arizona, for example, shows that Biden's lead is now greater than the poll's margin of error.
The same can be said of Florida, according to polls from CNN and Quinnipiac University.
Even Fox News, which leans far to the right and endorsed Trump in 2016, have published similar polls in their media outlets.
The President's last hope according to the polls is for Trump to regain support in important swing state areas if the campaign focus turns to the economy.
The US economy took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 pandemic, but voters don't seem to be linking the economic crisis with the coronavirus pandemic.
In other words, a vast majority of voters seems to blame Trump for responding poorly to the coronavirus pandemic but still trust him better to deal with the country's current economic crisis.
However, Trump has had difficulty directing the campaign discourse.
Following the practically continuous riots since reports surfaced of the horrific video showing four policemen killing George Floyd, Trump attempted to focus on policing and its importance.
Law and Order became his motto.
This seems to have failed completely, as has been noted.
As polls show Trump at an increasing disadvantage, it becomes more likely that more and more Republicans will abandon Trump and declare their support for either Biden or someone else, which means supporting Biden without naming him specifically.
They do this because of the American practice of voting in several elections on the same ballot.
That way, a voter can simply check one party in the presidential part of the ballot and make that count as a vote for all other candidates from that party on the ballot.
Thus, Republican candidates for other offices attempt to distance themselves from Trump's poor results and enjoy individual election success.
Dakar Youth Olympic Games delayed until 2026
The Youth Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have been moved to 2026 due to the coronavirus pandemic after an agreement between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Senegal.
The postponement of the first Olympic event to be held in Africa comes as a setback however for many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested in connection with the Nantes fire
A volunteer at Nantes Cathedral in France has been arrested in connection with the fire that completely destroyed the church.
Le Monde quotes the prosecutor as saying that the suspect, a Rwandan refugee who worked as a caretaker in the church, had admitted to setting the fire.
The man's lawyer said to another media outlet that the man greatly regretted his actions.
Among the items lost to the fire was a 17th century organ and the church's historic stained glass windows.
The volunteer, who is 39 years old but has not been named, was arrested shortly after the fire on 18 July but then released from custody.
He was interrogated again yesterday and subsequently arrested.
"No way out of this"
I was greeted warmly at the home of Baltasar and Kristjana Samper in Kópavogur.
The reason for my visit is a new art exhibition by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will open on 1 August in Hlaðan at Litli-Kambur, Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time that father and daughter hold a joint exhibition.
I was led into Baltasar's studio, where I was met with imposing paintings.
Large, gloomy pictures of women of past centuries but also flying creatures; an eagle in one, the shadows of a bird on another.
The studio opens up into the garden of the house.
"We had a horse here who ate the grass," Baltasar tells me.
"The horse works much better than a lawnmower on the mounds and hills that we have here."
Mireaya is with Kristjana, Baltasar and me, and she talks about how her pieces correspond to the pieces here.
"Installations, a mixture of paper pieces and jewellery sculptures.
They are all very white and in contrast to what dad is doing, as I am working with light and so forth," she says.
"This idea came up a year ago.
There were certain pieces that I was working on and would have liked to exhibit there, but they were stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When dad had begun painting and I saw the direction he was going, I reconsidered my part," Mireya says — Baltasar's work contains strong references to Icelandic folk tales about powerful women and supernatural beings.
"When I saw that dad was doing these paintings with the women, I thought it was ideal to make jewellery connected to them," says Mireya. She creates the jewellery in collaboration with goldsmith Sigurður Ingi Bjarnason of the shop Sign.
"Then I create an installation from the jewellery."
Last year, Mireya attended an exhibition by 72 artists from the Academy of the Senses in Snæfellsnes, including at Hlaðan at Litli-Kambur, and found the building captivating.
"It's a new space, an old barn that was recently renovated," says Mireya. While there, she chatted with art historian Baldvina Sverrisdóttir, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar hold a joint exhibition.
"She wanted us both to exhibit, and then we thought:
"Why not?
It's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and studied at the Barcelona Academy of Art before embarking on a tour around the world to visit art museums and conduct research.
He stopped in Iceland in 1961 and became fascinated with the country and its people.
He came back here a little while later, met his wife, Kristjana, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prolific artist, having held tens of solo exhibitions and exhibitions with Kristjana in many places.
He is best known for his large murals, including his wall decoration in Flatey Church and his fresco in Víðistaðir Church.
"My influence is the light that can only be found in Iceland and no other place," says Baltasar.
"The low sun and the shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I came here, I thought: "Wow, you can work here.""
Mireya is the oldest of Kristjana and Baltasar's children, born in 1964.
"There was one thing I knew very clearly: that I was not going to be an artist," she says when asked whether she wanted to follow the example of her parents.
"So I attended the math and natural sciences department at grammar school and did everything I could to get away from this.
Then I realised that I was on the run.
The only thing to do is to give up," says Mireya with a laugh.
She has, like her father, exhibited her work around the world.
Frequently in Japan, for example.
All of Baltasar and Kristjana's children have had a career in the arts.
"I call it a virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Believes Icelandair to have been in a grey area when airline hostesses were laid off
The Minister of Social Affairs believes Icelandair to have been in a grey area when the company laid off all airline hostesses in the middle of a wage dispute.
He also says that he requested a review of the law forbidding firefighters to enter residential properties following the fire at Bræðraborgarstígur.
On 17 July, Icelandair decided to lay off all 38 airline hostesses employed by the company while the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's wage dispute was still under consideration by the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer.
There were differing opinions about whether Icelandair's layoffs were legal and the case was expected to be resolved before the Labour Court.
That never happened, though, as the airline hostesses and Icelandair reached an agreement just over 24 hours after the layoffs.
However, Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason says that in his mind, Icelandair's decision was in a grey area and violated workers' rights.
"My opinion is that this is a certain right that is supposed to protect workers.
When you're negotiating and with the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer, this way should not be an option.
It's completely clear in my mind that this could not have been upheld.
I think it's completely clear, in my mind, that people had reached a grey area in that regard," says Ásmundur.
He would therefore not encourage other companies to go the same route as Icelandair.
"Now you also see dangerous talk of how normal it would be to reorganise this system to reduce this right, and I'm completely against that."
In Sprengisandur this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the administration's response to the fire at Bræðraborgarstígur in late June, where three people died.
The Minister says that the investigation of the case is now in the hands of the Housing and Construction Authority, to which he has provided instructions.
"According to the current law, the fire brigade may not enter residential properties.
I have asked the Housing and Construction Authority to look specifically into whether there is reason to make any legal amendments.
I'm prepared to propose the necessary legal amendments to reduce the chance of something like this happening again," says Ásmundur Einar.
The complete interview with Ásmundur can be heard in the player below.
US reportedly ramps up pressure on Nord Stream 2 contractors - RT Business News
The US government has made further attempts to force European firms to ditch the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing people familiar with talks on the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials from US Department of State, the Treasury Department, as well as the Department of Energy approached European contractors to make sure they fully understand the consequences of staying in the project.
Up to a dozen officials reportedly held at least two online conferences with representatives of the firms in recent days.
Speaking in a "friendly" manner, the US side stressed that it wanted to prevent completion of Nord Stream 2, observers of the online talks said.
"I believe the threat is very, very serious," one of them revealed to the German outlet.
Those threats are consistent with comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, in which he warned that companies involved in the project had better "get out now" or risk facing penalties under Section 232 of the notorious Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
Apart from Russia's energy major Gazprom, which is developing the project, five European companies have joined.
Those are France's Engie, Austria's OMV, the UK-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Germany's Uniper.
Speaking to Welt am Sonntag, the latter called US attempts to undermine the "important infrastructure project" a clear intervention into European sovereignty.
Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, meant to expand US sanctions on companies involved in installing Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the sponsors of the bill, the measures can target companies facilitating or providing vessels, insurance, port facilities, or tethering services for those vessels, as well as to those providing certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European businesses and government officials have repeatedly decried US attempts to meddle in European energy policy by sanctioning Nord Stream 2, with some even calling on Brussels to work on countermeasures.
Moscow has also lambasted Washington's move, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will develop a new strategy for completion of the project if Washington proceeds with new punitive measures.
Prepares to relocate more government agencies outside the capital area
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children intends to relocate more government agencies outside the capital area in the near future.
The Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be relocated to Sauðárkrókur next autumn, according to the Minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move to the north of the country.
This morning, Minister of Social Affairs and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason stated in an interview with Sprengisandur on Bylgjan that it was important for rural areas that government agencies move there.
That this would bring about great value creation which would also create diversity.
"It's vital for the national economy, we're trying to develop everything all around the country.
Economic development, development that brings in currency, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry or some kind of utilisation of nature, and the nature of government jobs is such that they will provide great support for this development," says Ásmundur.
"More diversity and better support for the nation's resource utilisation and currency income will be created."
Ásmundur's decision to relocate the Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Authority has been harshly criticised by its employees and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers.
Six men who have expert knowledge of fire issues and work in the department all live in the capital area, and none of them intends to move to Sauðárkrókur.
"I think it's completely clear that there are differing political opinions on how vigorously this should be pursued.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take drastic measures to distribute government jobs more evenly," says Ásmundur.
"We see that our neighbouring countries, Norway and Denmark, have been doing this successfully."
He says he is convinced that a vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of government agencies around the country.
"I think that there have to be more political decisions to relocate government jobs to rural areas, like I just did with the Housing and Construction Authority."
He takes the relocation of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and the Unemployment Insurance Payment Office to Skagaströnd as examples.
"That is now a highly important workplace for the Skagaströnd community.
I think we should take further steps in this direction."
"I'm preparing further steps in this direction.
More relocations."
Over forty arrests in Seattle
Widespread protests were held yesterday against systemic racism and the President's decision to send FBI troops to cities to quell riots.
More than forty protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used stun grenades and pepper spray in yesterday's large protest, which the police has now described as a riot.
21 police officers were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months have passed since a wave of protests against systemic racism began in the United States, following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police.
The protest was held as a show of solidarity with Portland protesters.
There have been repeated violent conflicts between police and protesters since the President deployed federal troops in unmarked cars there, against the wishes of local authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland over the weekend, and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets when conflicts arose between them and protesters.
Had a miracle baby at 47
American reality television star Kenya Moore does good deeds by supporting people in need of IVF.
Moore, who is known for her participation in the Real Housewives of Atlanta series, had her first baby at the age of 47, following IVF, and calls her daughter the Miracle Baby.
"I waited almost my whole life to have a baby," said Moore in an interview with People Magazine.
So I know the despair that people, particularly women, feel when they think that they may not be able to have a child."
When Moore turned forty, she realised that she was running out of time.
"I didn't want to have a baby on my own.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after I had turned forty, I looked up and thought "oh, my God,"" says Moore, who nevertheless did not meet the father of her child until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star says that her daughter is a miracle baby in more ways than one.
In addition to Moore being older than most first-time mothers, her daughter was born a month and a half before the due date.
Moore had a caesarean section which turned out to be complicated and take much longer than a standard caesarean section.
"I call her the Miracle Baby because she was a baby that everyone said I had no chance of having," said Moore in the interview.
Father-Son Arrested With Heroin Worth Rs 1.54 Crore In Mizoram
The heroin, worth around Rs 1.55 crore in the local market, was smuggled from Myanmar: Cops
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg heroin in Mizoram's Hnahthial district near the Myanmar border, the police said on Sunday.
The heroin, worth around Rs 1.55 crore in the local market, was smuggled from Myanmar, they said.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with the drugs on Friday night from Ngharchhip village, the police said.
They also dropped about Rs 280 grams of heroin, worth Rs 15 lakh, while swimming across a river as they tried to flee from the police, officials said.
According to police, the seizure was believed to be the biggest heroin haul in the state.
The accused were charged under the relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.
Even as the inter-state borders and the one with Myanmar remained sealed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, smuggling of drugs and other contrabands continued unabated, the police sources said.
The Assam Rifles recently seized 25 trucks loaded with betel nuts, valued at Rs 4 crore, being smuggled from Myanmar, they said.
Doctor ran 35 kilometres with face mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 kilometres in a face mask to prove that oxygen levels are not reduced when face masks are worn.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To disprove the theory about oxygen levels and encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to and from work while wearing a mask.
Before he set off, he started a GoFundMe campaign in support of the Trussell Trust, which donates food in Bradford and other places around the UK.
"I'm a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the falsehood that's been spread about face masks reducing people's oxygen levels," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in triathlon but that his endurance had been reduced during the pandemic.
He ran the 35 kilometres last Monday.
"The mask didn't come off at all (no food or drink) and oxygen levels were stubbornly 98% every time I checked," Lawton wrote on Twitter following his run.
Prince Joachim still in hospital
Prince Joachim has been hospitalised at the Toulouse University Hospital in France and his condition is stable.
The Prince underwent brain surgery yesterday after a blood clot had been discovered.
"Prince Joachim's condition is still stable.
Fortunately, the Prince received professional care in time and is feeling reasonably well.
It is too early to say at this time how long he'll stay at the hospital," says Lene Balleby, the Danish Crown's press officer in a written response to Danish State Radio.
It's been only a few days since the Royal Family celebrated the 18th birthday of Felix, Joachim's second oldest son.
The birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx in Cahors in the South of France.
The family was still holidaying there when Joachim was admitted to hospital yesterday.
Last year, 51 year old Joachim moved to France, where he studies at the Ecolé Militaire military academy, the first Dane to do so.
He also works as a defence specialist at the Danish embassy in Paris.
The Prince has strong ties to France, both his later father, Prince Henri and his wife, Princess Marie, being French.
Sells the apartment where she has lived for 30 years
Actress Susan Sarandon has put her New York home up for sale.
Sarandon has lived in the apartment for 30 years and raised all her children there.
The building where the apartment is located is in Manhattan's Chelsea neighbourhood and was built before the First World War.
The asking price is USD 7.9 million, or more than one billion Icelandic Krona.
The apartment is just over 560 square metres and is on the 7th and 8th floors of the building.
Sarandon bought the house in 1991 with her ex-husband, Tim Robbins.
When they divorced in 2011, Sarandon kept the house.
Sarandon and Robbins had Jack and Miles together, and she previously had her daughter, Eva.
All three children grew up in the apartment.
It has six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms.
The apartment is bright and pleasant with particularly beautiful interiors.
Utah plane crash: A baby and 2 adults are killed in a backyard crash
The crash happened Saturday afternoon when a Piper PA-32 aircraft carrying six people crashed into a backyard in the city of West Jordan, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said.
Three people aboard the plane were killed, including the pilot, identified by police as 43-year-old Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old baby, and Milda Shibonis, 36, West Jordan police said.
The pilot's wife is in critical condition, and a 2-year-old child has critical burns.
A 12-year-old girl was treated at a local hospital and released, West Jordan Police spokeswoman Jennifer Worthen told CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in a house struck by the plane is in critical condition, according to a tweet Sunday from the police department.
The crash also damaged three homes, West Jordan city spokesperson Tauni Barker said.
The cause of the crash has not been determined.
The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.
Gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it "very hard to open" schools in fall
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday it's going to be "very hard" for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities.
"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.
If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
With the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for in-person instruction five days a week.
But the push from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos comes as Mr. Trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely "get worse before it gets better" and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks.
Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance Thursday for how best to safely open schools for students.
The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.
But the CDC did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections, which Gottlieb said was "unfortunate."
"In the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution," he said.
"That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the CDC didn't do in its guidance."
Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.
A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."
"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community," Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.
But Gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including Arizona and Texas are beginning to plateau.
While Gottlieb said there are "unmistakable signs" the epidemic is slowing in some states across the Sun Belt, it's "heating up" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
Many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.
In addition to states issuing mask mandates, a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well.
McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.
Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.
"If we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness, just with masks that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school," he said.
While Mr. Trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate, he urged Americans last week to wear coverings, saying during a White House press briefing "they have an impact."
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "Watch this space"
Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the close-season by revealing star attacker Wilf Zaha wants to leave the club.
The Ivorian international has been at Selhurst Park for over five years and now looks set to depart, having previously been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.
Speaking post-match after the final day, Hodgson told TalkSport's Alex Crook to "watch this space" regarding Zaha's probable exit after acknowledging the forward has "made it clear" he sees his future away from the club.
The forward still has three years left on his current Palace deal and they last year suggested it would take £100m to prise him away from the club.
Hodgson's side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a final-day draw, dropping to 14th place in the process.
Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.
He was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away, but a bid didn't materialise to tempt Palace to sell.
In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.
Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.
Hurricane Hanna: Coronavirus-hit Texas faces new threat of catastrophic flooding in 'double whammy'
Forecasters are predicting "catastrophic flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna made landfall twice, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90mph.
It came ashore on Saturday as a category one storm (the lowest of the five levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm - but there could still be 15-30cm (6-12in) of rain on Sunday with 60mph winds.
Some areas have already reported getting up to 23cm (9in) of rainfall, including Cameron County, which borders Mexico.
Hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to stay alert, saying: "We're not even close to over at this point. We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."
Texas has already been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.
Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in the storm's path, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
He said: "Any hurricane is an enormous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and made even more severe, seeing that it's sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19."
The first landfall happened at 5pm on Saturday, 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second took place nearby in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power on Saturday evening.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi have placed barricades near intersections so they are ready to use if streets flood.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump said his administration was monitoring Hanna, along with Hurricane Douglas, which was heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Resident Sherry Boehme, who lives along a beach in Corpus Christi, said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic.
The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease.
She said: "It's almost like a double whammy to us.
I think it's made a lot of people nervous.
"We'll get through it.
Everybody is good and strong and sticks together."
Haymaking going very well in South Iceland
Haymaking in South Iceland has gone unusually well this summer as the weather has been advantageous for farmers.
Most have cut their grass once, the second round has begun in many places and some are expected to be able to cut their grass for the third time in late summer.
The summer weather has been kind to South Iceland farmers, like other inhabitants of the region, and the growth of the grass in their fields does not make matters worse.
Haymaking has therefore gone well.
Sigurður Ágústsson, dairy farmer at Birtingarholt in Hrunamannahreppur and haymaking contractor, is pleased.
"Yes, this has been going very well, and I think the farmers must be optimistic; it's gone smoothly as the weather has been excellent for the last two weeks.
The hay is very good as the harvest is good and overall hay quality is fine," says Sigurður.
Sigurður says that more people, not least dairy farmers, have been using stacks or pits in haymaking with great success, although it's by far most common to use bales.
"It's lively, yes, yes. In fact, this has been very convenient for the past two or three weeks because the weather has been so nice and dry, making it easy to manage.
It makes all the difference, there's less stress and you can sometimes delay what could be done today until tomorrow so it's splendidly convenient.
But does Sigurður think that any farmers will cut the grass a third time?
"Yes, that could very well be, those who were first.
We started on 17 June. It's very possible that those who were first may have to cut something three times."
An original solution by the Wolves - This is how they prevent injuries
Adama Traoré, winger with Premier League side Wolves, is an incredibly fast player.
His opponents have occasionally grabbed him to make sure that he didn't overtake them.
His shoulder has been dislocated several times because of this, but now the Wolves have found a solution to the problem.
The Sun reported on this.
In the Wolves' match against Crystal Palace, medics could be seen rubbing something on Traoré's shoulders.
"This is something that we had to do to protect Traoré," said a source within the Wolves camp — and the thing that was being rubbed on him was baby oil.
"Making him more slippery makes it more difficult for defenders to grab him and that way we can prevent further injuries."
Traoré's shoulder was first dislocated when Wolves played Tottenham in December.
Since then, his shoulder has been dislocated four times, the last time in a match against Sheffield United earlier this month.
Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
Mr Stott told Sky News that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback.
The former soldier called for more focus on the good the couple do including their charity work.
Mr Stott said: "I think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback."
"You have got an author's persona, it is still not guaranteed that it has come from them."
"I just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them."
"I understand they are in the public eye and people wish to know what they are doing but I wish the focus was more on the good that they do and the charity work rather than their intimate privacies."
"But because of who they are they will never get away from that of course."
On Saturday a royal historian also stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex supporting the Queen "overshadowed" other members of the Royal Family.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the Royal Family were unable to harness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's star power.
The royal commentator added that the Royal Family has a strict hierarchy but that public interest cannot be directed or controlled.
She continued: "The fact is that whatever they did to support the Queen would often overshadow other members of the Royal Family and that was seen as a problem."
"They have this huge star power."
"They had a small wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne had a huge wedding."
"They had a small wedding but still the coverage of Harry and Meghan's wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as William's and Kate's because there is a worldwide fascination with them."
Donald Trump admits he often regrets his Twitter rants
Donald Trump has admitted he frequently regrets the incendiary posts he makes on Twitter.
Speaking to Barstool Sports Friday, the President of the United States admitted that his unchecked retweets - which have included pro-white supremacist material - get him in the most trouble.
Asked by journalist Dave Portnoy if he regretted his posts, Trump answered: "Often, too often.
It used to be in the old days before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say this letter is very big.
You put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do that with Twitter, right?
We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls - "Did you really say this?"
I say, "What's wrong with that?" and you find out a lot of things."
Last month, Trump sparked fury after retweeting (sharing content from another account) a video of his supporters in The Villages area of Florida, with the elderly pair filmed exclaiming "White power!"
And in 2017, Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim tweets posted by Jayda Fransen, leader of far-right fringe political party Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the retweets that got him in the most trouble
Trump said: "You see something that looks good and you don't investigate it and you don't know what's on the helmet exactly, right, which is a miniature and you don't blow it up, it sometimes - I have found that almost always it's the retweets that get you in trouble."
The president often shares praise for himself, rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million Twitter followers.
Trump says Twitter helps him cut through so-called "fake news" reports on TV shows and newspapers he claims are riddled with falsehoods.
But the president's own lies have frequently come under the microscope, with Twitter now flagging up Trump tweets that are inaccurate.
GPS may be unsecure
Many countries are now developing position technology that's an alternative to the Global Positioning System, GPS.
An engineering lecturer says that there may be reason to be concerned about the security of the GPS, which is owned by the US Army.
The old LORAN system is undergoing a renaissance.
GPS technology follows us everywhere we go.
We use it when we fly, sail and drive, for surveying, in industry and for recreation.
Most people don't consider the fact that it is a military tool owned by the US Army, which didn't make it available for civilian use until the 1980s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite 20,000 kilometres above the ground, so natural conditions have little effect on it.
"But it's very easy to disrupt it.
And people with bad intentions can easily disrupt the reception of these signals," says Sæmundur E. Þorsteinsson, engineering lecturer at the University of Iceland and expert in risk management and telecommunication security.
He says that it's also easy to send a false signal with an incorrect location, in warfare for example.
"The GPS is owned by the US Department of Defense.
They have ensured the public that the system is available at all times.
But they could certainly turn it off if a highly eccentric President would get the idea to do such a thing, he could presumably do that," says Sæmundur.
Other nations have therefore begun to consider other systems and position technology.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is putting the location system Galileo into use.
"The Galileo system is mainly developed for civilian use.
It is perhaps slightly more accurate and is of course controlled by the European Union.
That means that it's controlled by many governments rather than a single government," says Sæmundur.
Many have also begun reconsidering the old LORAN technology.
It is based on radio waves and was in use from the 1950s and until it was replaced by GPS technology.
LORAN signals are transmitted through low frequency radio signals by land-based transmitters.
"It would be a new version of the LORAN system called eLoran, or Enhanced Loran, which is under serious consideration as a backup system in many countries because disrupting it requires using somewhat different principles; it's much more difficult than to disrupt a satellite system," says Sæmundur.
However, it's probably safest to have access to as many positioning systems as possible.
Longtime staffer of Rep. Vern Buchanan dies of coronavirus
"Gary was the consummate professional and a true public servant in every sense of the word," Buchanan said on Facebook.
"He touched so many lives and was loved and respected by those who knew him.
I will never forget his uplifting spirit, sense of humor and sheer joy at helping others."
Rep. Buchanan's office had tweeted a statement earlier this month that Tibbetts did not have any recent interactions with anyone else in the office.
Tibbetts, a field representative, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the pandemic, above New York's 411,200, according to state health agencies.
The number of hospitalizations has increased by 79% since the Fourth of July, data from the state's health care administration shows.
At least 50 hospital intensive care units in Florida have reached capacity on Saturday, the agency's data shows.
"We've advised that's something that could make an impact," DeSantis said in June.
"At the same time, to do police and put criminal penalties on that is something that probably would backfire."
Flew from Hornafjörður to Cape Town
The Eurasian collared dove, common wood pigeon, two-barred crossbill, black-throated loon and common crane are some of the birds that have strayed to Iceland this summer.
Fuglar.is, the website of the South East Iceland Birds Observatory, has almost daily brief reports of such rare birds, where they were spotted and sometimes their sex.
Iceland has many bird enthusiasts.
One sign of this interest is the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic Bird Species.
The group has around 14,600 members.
Members share photographs of birds and it is obvious that Iceland has plenty of good photographers who have the patience to photograph birds.
Brynjúlfur Brynjólfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he's called, is an employee of the South East Iceland Birds Observatory and the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre, and a close observer of bird life in the area.
He talks affectionately about these animals who enrich the Iceland fauna and have an important function, whether they be a big and powerful bird of prey or a tiny passerine bird.
The South East Iceland Birds Observatory was established in 2005, on the birthday of Hálfdán Björnsson from Kvísker in Öræfi, with the aim of continuing the important natural research carried out by him from 1940 onwards.
"Hálfdán was thirteen years old when he began gathering information on birds," says Brynjúlfur in a conversation with Kjarninn.
"We're not doing exactly the same things he did at the Observatory, but we're building on his data by counting and tagging birds."
Hálfdán was a farmer and amateur scientist, born on 14 March, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects and bird life.
He passed away shortly before his 90th birthday, on 10 February 2017.
Many of those who got to know Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvísker began to share their interest in Icelandic nature.
One of them is Björn Gísli Arason, the South East Iceland Birds Observatory's "other employee".
Björn grew up at Reynivellir in Suðursveit, where he received extensive education in nature from his neighbour, Hálfdán at Kvísker.
But what on earth does the South East Iceland Birds Observatory do?
Around 20 March of each year, the Observatory puts up special bird nets in Einarslundur, a grove close to Höfn í Hornafirði.
Birds caught in the nets are tagged with standard marks.
The nets are taken down around 10 May, at the start of nesting season.
The nets are up all day, from at least six in the morning and into the afternoon.
And they have to be checked once every hour.
The birds caught in them are tagged, measured and then released.
Once every hour, the reporter asks in amazement.
"Yes, we divide it between us, Bjössi and me.
As we also have to make a living, this can be quite a puzzle, but we somehow manage to tend to this," says Brynjólfur.
The nets are put up again between 1 August and 10 November — every day, weather permitting.
Between their turns watching the nets and during the times when they are not up, Brynjólfur and Jón are tagging arctic terns, great skuas and various moorland birds wherever they can catch them.
They also take on various special projects.
One of these projects is a collaboration with the Icelandic Institute of Natural History and involves collecting castor bean ticks from birds.
"The castor bean ticks jump on the birds in their winter location and then hitch a ride with them when they come here in spring.
This happens shortly before they set off so the ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then they jump from the bird and try to find another host when they have to."
But enough about ticks.
When asked how the birds of South-East Iceland are doing this summer, Brynjúlfur replies that the arctic tern's egg-laying seems to be going well — where it lays eggs at all.
"The arctic tern's main nesting grounds are at Hali in Suðursveit, and everything is going well there.
There are no nesting grounds at Jökulsárlón anymore, however, where there were huge nesting grounds several years ago."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand arctic tern pairs laid eggs there, but now they can be counted on one hand.
"When we look at moorland birds and shorebirds, it seems like you find fewer of them in the last few years.
But of course there's always variation from one year to another."
Brynjúlfur thinks that this great shift is probably due to food supply.
"Everything revolves around food, of course."
He says that human activity could also have an effect on the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to be doing rather well in South-East Iceland this summer.
"One positive thing I've found is that the number of arctic skuas is increasing again after a great lull," says Brynjólfur, "but meanwhile, the great skua has suffered terrible decline in the last years and decades."
As for passerine birds, it seems like the white wagtail should do well in its egg-laying this summer, like it did last year.
There are somewhat fewer redwings and meadow pipits, but Brynjúlfur says that it won't become clear until next autumn how the summer turned out for them.
But let's talk about the stray birds.
They often cause quite a bit of stir, particularly if they are very rare or perhaps colourful.
These two interesting factors apply to one of the summer's most popular strays: the common wood pigeon.
"But this summer has actually been relatively quiet when it comes to strays," says Brynjúlfur, but notes that a common crane can now be found in the area, and that common wood pigeons have been spotted and are beginning to nest here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn come into contact with strays, they tag them just like other birds.
The tags are international and used all over the world.
Tagging can provide various information, e.g. about the birds' winter location, where they nest and their migration routes.
"You can even see how long they are in flight during migration," Brynjólfur points out.
This information is useful in many respects, for instance when it comes to epidemics such as bird flus.
"Our knowledge is constantly being expanded."
If someone abroad finds a bird tagged by the South East Iceland Birds Observatory, the information is sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.
"We have had recoveries all the way in Cape Town, South Africa.
An arctic tern that we had tagged was found there.
One of our arctic terns was later found in the United States."
One bird is particularly close to Brynjúlfur's heart: the great skua.
"The great skua is our bird," he says, pointing out that the South East Iceland Birds Observatory and the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre have the task of monitoring its survival status — which has become rather poor, placing it on the watch list.
It's hard to say with any certainty what caused the population drop but according to one theory, the great skua used to benefit from the catch thrown into the sea from fishing vessels, with a corresponding effect on the population now that the catch is utilised much more extensively.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
"You obviously can't get me to say no," says Brynjólfur with a laugh, adding: "We're also chasing strays so we have to go to more places."
But South-East Iceland is certainly unique when it comes to its bird life.
"This area is like a bottleneck where birds come into the country from Europe before dispersing.
It's very interesting to be here and observe migratory birds and strays but there are fewer nesting birds here than in many other parts of the country.
There isn't much distance between the shore and the glacier so the area as such is well suited for bird watching."
But does Brynjúlfur have a favourite bird?
He thinks for a little while before replying.
He finds the question difficult.
„The pied avocet is my bird, as I've found nine of the ten spotted in Iceland," he answers at last.
"Photographing the common snipe may be the most fun.
Then it's always good to find birds that have never or rarely been seen before in Iceland, not to mention finding a new species for Europe."
Both Binni and Bjössi have indeed done that.
You can look at Binni and Bjössi's work on Facebook and the website Fuglar.is to follow their work with the South East Iceland Birds Observatory more closely.
Saudi Arabia – beach resort of the future? No alcohol or bikinis
The tourism industry has grown enormously all over the world in recent years and now, Saudi Arabian authorities want their share of the pie.
They intend to spend the equivalent of ISK 60,000 billion to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reported this.
But this tourist paradise won't be in the style that Icelanders are accustomed to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women won't be permitted to sunbathe in bikinis.
But how can tourists be enticed to visit this strictly religious Islamic country?
The ways to do so includes building a new city with white beaches, a moon (man-made of course), drone taxis and robots to serve people.
The Guardian reports that Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the one who wants to embark on this investment.
The money will of course come from the country's oil wealth.
The Crown Prince says that it's out of the question for women to avoid covering their shoulders and knees in public while admitting that it's not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in a country where it's too hot when the sun is high in the air and you can't rely on the wind chill.
But then it's also possible that the unability to buy alcohol might dampen the interest of potential tourists.
Francois Bozize, deposed CAR leader, announces presidential bid
Deposed former Central African Republic President Francois Bozize announced on Saturday his candidacy for the December presidential vote despite being under United Nations sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.
He made the announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party, Kwa na Kwa (Work, Nothing But Work), in the capital Bangui.
The 73-year-old former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and continuing humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide, but has not moved to arrest him since he returned from exile late last year.
It is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the UN to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for Anti-balaka Christian armed groups.
Touadera governs today with the support of a large UN peacekeeping operation with more than 13,000 troops and police.
Elected in 2016, he is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run.
The first round of the race is scheduled for December 27.
The government signed a peace deal in February 2019 with 14 armed groups, who typically claim to defend the interests of specific communities or religions.
Violence has since generally receded, but there are still bloody incidents, typically sparked by fighting over resources and most of the diamond-rich country remains beyond government control.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's situation at Real Madrid is 'unsatisfactory for everyone', says Toni Kroos
Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos says Gareth Bale's situation at the Spanish side is 'unsatisfactory for everyone'.
Bale did not feature in any of the last seven games and was a peripheral figure in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations ahead of a summer stand-off as the player looks to stay and see out his contract and the club hope he will leave.
"There is no way to avoid the situation being unsatisfactory for everyone," Kroos told the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport! podcast.
"They certainly didn't sign him to play as little as he is now.
"I think in principle he wanted to leave last summer and that the club said 'yes' in principle and then 'no' after that.
"I don't know if he's still a little angry because of that. It's a difficult matter."
Asked if the situation had a negative effect on the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: "Certainly not as much as it might seem.
"Everything is good with the team. I have known him for six years and we have won some important things together."
China gives Reykjanesbær 2,000 face masks to support the fight against Coronavirus
Last week, Chinese Ambassador Jin Zhijian delivered two thousand face masks to the mayor of Reykjanesbær.
This was done on the occasion of the mayor's visit to the Chinese embassy on 22 July.
Víkurfréttir first reported this.
The purpose of the mayor's visit was to reciprocate the Chinese ambassador's visit to Reykjanesbær, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Víkurfréttir, they discussed strengthening the twin town relationship, established in 2014, between the municipalities of Reykjanesbær and Xianyang.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, can be traced to this twin town relationship, as city authorities in Xianyang wished to donate masks to support the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Víkurfréttir's report states that the masks will be used in vulnerable institutions and establishment in Reykjanesbær, both for staff and visitors.
The accompanying photo shows the flags of Iceland and China and an inscription on the face mask box reading "Bare is back without brother behind it".
Thomsen wants to leave KR - expects a salary cut
Tobias Thomsen will attempt to go home to Denmark and leave Icelandic champions KR next month, and says that he senses interest from members of the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and been Icelandic champion with both Valur and KR.
But now the 27-year old striker says that he's beginning to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefanía Jakobsdóttir.
The term of the Danish player's contract with KR is until the end of this season so it is clear that a Danish club would have to negotiate a transfer fee with KR to get him in August, before the next Danish season begins.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
"Yes, I know that the Danish leagues start again in late August.
Of course, that means that I would have to terminate my contract with KR, but I have told them that I miss Denmark and they have full understanding of that," said Thomsen in an interview with bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with manager Rúnar Kristinsson, who understood the situation completely, and Thomsen said that he did not believe that the transfer fee would be much of a problem.
"I also had discussions with two 1st Division teams when the league was winding down and the teams knew where they would end up.
There has already been some interest regarding the upcoming season, so I could very possibly go to Denmark before the Icelandic league is finished," said Thomsen, while adding that there weren't many Danish teams that could buy up his contract with KR.
"It's not completely clear now, but there has been interest.
I also have to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who is Icelandic and will come with me.
It depends on several things," said Thomsen and added that he was mainly considering Copenhagen.
Thomsen said that KR did not have to worry about him not making a full effort in training sessions and matches although he misses Denmark.
"KR knows what it's getting from me, which is 100 percent in everything I do.
I can always disregard the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm training or playing matches," said Thomsen, adding that leaving the Icelandic champions to join Denmark's second highest league would obviously mean a cut in his salary.
"I would probably have to take a little salary cut because of the coronavirus crisis, which seems to have had a rather bigger effect on the Danish clubs than the Icelandic ones.
But I'm also a student and one solution could be for the club to provide me with a job.
Seeing that most 1st Division clubs have a sponsorship agreement.
I'm studying sports management through the players' association and finishing a BA degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only twice been a member of KR's starting lineup in the Pepsi Max League this season, but he has been involved in five matches and scored one goal.
Last season, he started 21 times for the team and scored seven goals.
KR is tied for points with Valur at the top of the Pepsi Max League but has yet to play its match against KA in Akureyri today.
Coronavirus row breaks out on bus as driver gets in fiery exchange over face masks
In the footage passengers and the driver onboard the Arriva bus service in Liverpool clash over the use of face masks.
The bus driver can be heard explaining to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear face masks.
The bus driver said: "It's not my job to ask everyone who comes on the bus about wearing a mask."
A witness said regarding the incident: "A man and an older woman started ganging up on her and a massive row erupted."
"The bus driver had to get out of his seat and came over to demand what was going on and he told one woman she wasn't even wearing her mask properly."
"That woman then stormed off the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesperson for Arriva said: "The safety of our customers and employees continues to be our priority.
"The wearing of face coverings continues to be mandatory for customers whilst using public transport (exemptions apply)."
"We have clear guidance and signage for customers in regards to this and all other social distancing measures in place on bus, via social media and our website."
It has been mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport since June 15.
Worldwide there have been more than 16.3 million COVID-19 cases.
The death toll has reached more than 650,000.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus across the globe.
The US has the most COVID-19 cases in the world with more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls on Hollywood to increase casting of people with disabilities
The actress is part of a new PSA that calls for increased inclusion of those with disabilities in entertainment.
The campaign coincides with Sunday's 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The video shows Spencer discussing the importance of everyone being able to see themselves and their lives accurately reflected on screen.
"Nothing can replace lived experience and authentic representation," she said.
"That's why it's imperative that we cast the appropriate actor for the appropriate role."
Spencer discussed the impact she felt seeing a family of color on screen as a young girl watching the show "Good Times."
The series, which ran on CBS from 1974 to 1979, was created by Norman Lear and broke barriers as television's first African American two-parent family sitcom.
Hunger organization pushes out Yoho after Capitol incident
WASHINGTON (AP) - A nonpartisan Christian organization that seeks to end hunger said Saturday it asked for and received the resignation of Rep. Ted Yoho from its board of directors following what it called his "verbal attack" on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol.
Yoho maintained he did not use the words cited, though a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed the language as she described it.
In a statement, Bread for the World said its board met Friday with Yoho and sought his resignation "as an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color, nationally and globally, as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world."
On its website, Bread for the World says its "collective Christian voice" lobbies Congress and the administration on ending hunger nationally and worldwide.
"As a bipartisan Christian organization committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through sound public policies, Bread for the World upholds the values of respect, dignity, and compassion that Jesus calls us to when engaging decision makers from across the political spectrum," the statement said.
"We believe that Rep. Ted Yoho's recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our Board of Directors."
A spokesman for Yoho did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
In an extraordinary speech Thursday in the House, Ocasio-Cortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of "accepting violence and violent language against women."
More than a dozen colleagues joined her in casting the incident as all-too-common male behavior.
Yoho has described the encounter as a brief policy discussion and said that "no one was accosted, bullied, or attacked."
He expressed regret for his "abrupt manner."
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a freshman progressive who has gained praise and criticism for her outspokenness.
Yoho, 65, one of the most conservative members of the House, is retiring at the end of his fourth term.
Waited until the 98th minute in the last game to score the season's first goal
Jesse Lingard hadn't scored a goal or provided an assist in the Premier League this season until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute in the League's final round.
Lingard hadn't scored in the Premier League since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came on as a substitute for Manchester United today in the team's deciding match against Leicester for a place in the Champions League.
After more than seven minutes of injury time, Lingard caught the ball from Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and scored into the empty goal.
A long-awaited goal for Jesse Lingard.
Real Madrid players exempt from quarantine rules
Zinedine Zidane and his Real Madrid players will be able to go to England for their second Champions League match against Manchester City without having to be quarantined for two weeks.
British authorities have decided that travellers from Spain must be quarantined for two weeks in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
There are exceptions to this, however, such as in the case of teams at the top level of sports.
The Minister of Sports confirmed this to Sky Sports.
According to the Ministry, persons who are exempt from the rules will only stay in special areas behind closed doors.
This is supposed to apply to sports stars, referees, trainers, medical teams and the members of the media.
Thus, the Madridians, who are behind after their 2-1 loss on Santiago Bernebeu on 26 February, are able to face Manchester City on 7 August without having to stay too long in England.
The winning team goes on to the quarter-final, which will take place in Portugal.
Heavy rain and depression across the country on the bank holiday weekend
Judging from the reports of overfull hotels and campsites, at least in the south of the country, Icelanders have travelled extensively around the country this summer.
Travellers have also enjoyed exceptionally good weather, and DV's weather commentators all agree that the summer has been just splendid, at least up to this point.
But the Bank Holiday Weekend, which has traditionally been the biggest travel weekend of the year, draws closer.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, as it is now clear that events that have attracted large crowds in ordinary years will not be held.
The Westman Islands National Festival is just one example.
The weather will also play a large part, of course, and now it seems like there will be heavy rain all over the country, particularly in the south and southwest.
The Meteorological Office predicts heavy rain from Thursday evening until at least Saturday evening.
It should be noted that long-term forecasts have not always proven to be gospel truth here in the North Atlantic, and they could probably change.
Famed meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in the forecast on his weather website, Blika, that a depression is expected on the Bank Holiday Weekend.
He says: Troughs in the upper atmosphere, with a corresponding cold that often extends down to the surface, cause a depression with wind and rain to form when the warmer air from the southwest attempts to enter.
Also of course warmer air that "blows" to the north.
Einar publishes a prognostic chart to support his forecast and says: "A small wave from America spreads to the east and with it, summer-warm air.
When it approaches, it manages to "flower" in the form of dropping air pressure and a considerable summer depression."
The big forecast models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to the left on the map and the American GFS forecast to the right are pretty much in agreement on this development.
According to the forecast, the front of the depression will pass on late Thursday and early Friday with a strong wind from the east and rain in most of the country.
A 985 hPa centre of low will then follow.
This time, somewhat warm air will follow in the north and east of the country on Saturday and even on Sunday as well.
However, there could also be wind along with this.
Man seriously hurt as cattle truck overturns in Wexford
A man has been seriously injured in a road traffic collision that occurred earlier today on Ferrycarrig Bridge, Wexford.
A cattle truck lost control going over the bridge and, in the process, overturned onto an unoccupied parked car.
The 34-year-old driver was seriously injured during the incident that took place around 1.50pm today.
He has been removed to Wexford General Hospital and remains in a serious condition.
Garda forensic investigators are currently examining the scene and the bridge remains closed with local diversions in place.
A number of cattle died in the collision.
Gardaí are appealing for anyone who was travelling on the road from 1.45pm to 2pm - or anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed the incident - to contact Wexford Garda Station on 053 916 5200, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda station.
Followed an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I had a crush on her, one of those youthful crushes that you have," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, lead actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so captivated by the actress that she showed up at the shooting location for the series and waited for her for hours, just to be able to say "hi".
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, watched, like so many Icelanders, the thriller series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit in the early 2000s, she fell completely for the lead actress, Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her encounter with the actress in the programme Love Stories on Rás 1.
When Birna herself was a teenager, at the age when many people begin to develop raging crushes, she did not have the same experience as her peers because she was busy suppressing her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young, cool-looking movie heartthrobs, but wasn't interested at all.
"I was cutting out pictures from pop magazines and hanging pictures of the Backstreet Boys and Jared Leto on the wall.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding the fact that I was a lesbian."
She says that people who come out of the closet are often said to experience delayed puberty.
"We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage urges, these crushes and so on.
I think that this was one of the things that attracted me to her," says Birna about the actress.
"And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I just had a crush on her."
The actress got lucky when she was in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a film in the city and recruited Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helgi Guðjónsson, to assist with the shoot.
"We were working as part of a crew of 30 and spent quite a bit of time with strangers.
Of course, spending such a long time together each day creates an intimate atmosphere, so we talked about everything and nothing."
One day, the talk turned to how much of a fan of Mariska Birna is.
One woman on the crew said that her friend was acquainted with the actress because he was part of the show's crew.
Birna could not stop thinking about this fact and asked her new friend regularly how her friend liked working with the actress and whether Birna could meet her.
"She told me to stop, that she had no idea whether she could make this happen," says Birna.
When the film shoot was finally over, the crew celebrated and Birna made a final attempt to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
"She had had a few drinks and said that she would take care of it."
A few days later, Birna sent the woman a message to ask whether something was happening in this matter.
The woman didn't respond, at which point Birna decided to give up.
But one morning she awoke to a long-awaited message.
"I looked at the phone and screamed.
The screams woke Gunnar Helgi up, and I said: I have to take a shower, make myself pretty and go downtown."
The woman had written to Birna to say that her friend and the cast and crew of Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
"I don't know when they start or when they stop but this is the name of the hotel, good luck," read the message. Birna got dressed in a hurry. She asked the reception were the shoot was taking place, and took the lift up to the 45th floor, where the group was gathered.
Birna found a spot and waited until a woman in the crew came to her and asked this woman who no one had invited, if she could help her with anything.
"I said that I was looking for Jason, and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived."
When the friend finally came, he looked at Birna in amazement and asked how on earth she managed to reach the set, as there was supposed to be heavy security.
Birna explained that she had just taken the lift, and asked to meet Mariska.
"Well, I don't know.
Sit here," said the friend and Birna sat down.
An extra from the series sat beside her, and they began to chat.
"I said to him: I'm a fan, what about you?" says Birna.
"I acted like this was the most normal thing in the world."
Time passed and Birna waited.
The actors came out regularly during breaks in shooting to have snacks, and Birna looked around in search of Mariska, who was nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend came and told her that unfortunately he was leaving.
Birna asked him to pass her on to another crew member, as she had no intention of going anywhere yet.
Surprised, the friend agreed and fetched another crew member.
„He brought another friend of his and said: This is the woman from Iceland who's dying to meet Mariska."
Then he left.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend came running to Birna.
"He said: Hurry.
The circumstances today are unusual. There are reporters with her, so she won't stop.
She'll go directly to the car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down to find her trailer.
It's white and is marked.
Hurry up."
"Then I looked to the right and was astounded" Birna rushed to take the lift down to Times Square.
There she found around forty trailers, some marked and some not.
She didn't find Mariska's trailer anywhere, however, and she began to feel desperate.
"I found the sense of defeat come over me because I had spent half a day on this, but then I thought oh well, I tried.
This was fun."
Feeling disheartened, Birna began walking back to the hotel, where she saw the crew look at her through the window with pity in their eyes, as it was clear that Birna had not succeeded at what she had set out to do.
Birna accepted her fate and it began to rain.
"I went under a shelter to protect myself from the rain.
Then I looked to the right and was astounded."
None other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in the trouser suit that she wears on the show and Birna knows quite well — but Birna was so emotional that she could hardly move.
"I looked at my body and arms and thought, now you have to move.
Now you have to go over to her."
Birna did so, and gathered the courage to poke the actress's shoulder.
"She looked at me and I could barely say anything.
But I just greeted her and said hello," Birna recalls.
"I said that I was from Iceland and was a big fan.
She said: How nice to meet you."
The conversation wasn't much longer, as Mariska's car had arrived and the horn honked for her.
Mariska turned to Birna and said: "I have to go but it was incredibly nice to meet you."
Birna said goodbye to her idol, watched the car drive away and then collapsed.
"I was weeping when I called Erlingur and Gunni, and they thought that this hadn't worked.
But I was crying because of the release of pent-up tension and the joy.
I said: Yes, I met her. You have to meet me now.
Then we celebrated with club soda and tequila," says Birna.
She has no regrets, although she admits that she would probably not do this again.
"This is a once in a lifetime thing, to sacrifice time and energy to make something like this happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir for the programme Love Stories on Rás 1.
The police will not spread the virus
There is no reason to worry that the coronavirus could spread with the breathalysers used by the police.
This is according to a police officer in the traffic division of the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police, in an interview with mbl.is.
Mbl.is has received comments from people who are worried about the same mouthpiece being used for all drivers when the police positions itself on a busy traffic street and lets all who pass by blow into a breathalyser.
However, the police says that strict hygiene measures are observed.
"In fact, these are not special mouthpieces but breathalysers with a cup for people to blow into," the policeman says.
"Some want to put their lips to it, but we instruct people to keep a little distance, a few tens of centimetres."
When asked if this is considered sufficient distance, the policeman says that he believes so.
If the test turns out to be positive, the police uses another breathalyser.
That one has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Stomach bloating: Tips to reduce pain include taking anise
The link to depression is not coincidental.
People living with IBS, a disorder characterised by abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhoea, frequently suffer from anxiety and depression, which can worsen symptoms, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA).
"That's because the colon is in part controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress," explains the ADAA.
If your bloating still persists, it could be a sign of a food intolerance.
Judge denies attempt to stop order requiring release of children in immigration custody
In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.
But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.
The three ways Gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ICE detention together, releasing children to a sponsor, or releasing families based upon a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyecto Dilley, an organization that offers legal services to families in detention, decried the move as allowing ICE to decide whether to continue keeping children detained.
"The bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ICE agrees to do it or families agree to be separated," Fluharty said.
Families are detained in three facilities run by ICE -- Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
Children at the facilities range from ages 1 to 17, according to lawyers and advocates who provide legal assistance.
Gee -- who oversees implementation of the Flores Agreement, which governs care of children in custody -- said in June that given "non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules," it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities.
There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.
Of those, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes and one in Dilley, two of the family detention centers.
Overall, there have been more than 3,700 confirmed cases in custody
Will consider laws on the independence of board members
The Prime Minister says it's not unnatural for pension funds to establish criteria on workers' rights in their investment policy.
The Central Bank Governor's comments on the need to ensure the independence of Board members of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken under consideration.
When Icelandair ceased negotiating with the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and laid off all airline hostesses, the Board of VR declared that VR-appointed members of the Board of the Pension Fund of Commerce would boycott or vote against the pension fund's participation in Icelandair's upcoming stock offering.
VR Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson subsequently said that members of the Board would be replaced if they did not follow these instructions.
Ragnar withdrew this statement three days later, however, as did the Board of VR.
Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson said to RÚV News on Friday that the independence of pension fund Board members in the funds' decisions had to be ensured, possibly with a legal amendment.
Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir says that the independence of pension fund Board members is important but believes that it is already ensured by law.
"Now the Central Bank Governor, who is of course the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, under whose authority this is, says that the regulatory environment around this independence should be examined specifically, and we will of course take this under consideration if there is anything that has to be reviewed," she says.
Katrín says that according to law, pension funds should establish ethical criteria in their investment policy.
Such policies should preferably deal with the social and ethical criteria that they want to focus on in their investments.
"I would also not consider it unnatural for pension funds to establish criteria on workers' rights in their investment policy.
But I think it's natural for such decisions to be made through policy development rather than individual investment decisions," says Katrín.
"Intolerable traffic jams at Ölfusá Bridge" says Árborg's Municipal Council President
Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson, calls the daily traffic jams by Ölfusá Bridge in Selfoss completely intolerable.
He hopes that an invitation to tender for a new bridge across Ölfusá will take place this autumn.
As Icelanders embark on travels across their country, with heavy traffic on the country's highways, a traffic jam is created by the Ölfus Bridge every day as drivers try to reach Selfoss or drive through the municipality.
Long lines are created by the bridge and waiting in line can test the patience of drivers.
"Yes, it's completely intolerable. This is one big traffic jam here, and not only on Fridays because now it's also on working days.
There are long lines, sometimes extending to Hellisheiði, for those who want to pass through here on their way to the east of the country and those who are heading west, so it's obvious that we need a new bridge, preferably no later than yesterday," says Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson.
Helgi says that municipal authorities in Árborg recently had a very positive meeting with the head of the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration and one of its designers.
"I think it's safe to say that there is more reason to be optimistic about work being done on this than ever before, because there's really something being done, and we should see a tender invitation for a new bridge next autumn."
But has Helgi any advice to the drivers stuck in the line at Ölfusá Bridge every day of the summer?
"Yes, you can drive across Þrengsli and through Eyrarbakki to be quicker, but those who are heading east cannot be told to cross Lyngdalsheiði, while those who are heading upcountry should use Mosfellsheiði, Þingvellir and Lyngdalsheiði."
Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson, who calls the traffic jams at Ölfusá Bridge outside Selfoss intolerable.
There are long lines at Ölfusá Bridge every day, with drivers often having to wait for some time before crossing the bridge.
In that case, the only thing to do is to draw a deep breath and think positive thoughts.
Future of north Brisbane koala habitat site goes to planning court
The council said as well as being critical koala, squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat, it was a key link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek bushland corridors.
The property developers have appealed the council's rejection in the Planning and Environment Court, arguing the development complies with City Plan 2014 legislation, would satisfy an unmet town planning and community need and could "be undertaken without any unacceptable impacts."
Strong community opposition persists over the proposed development.
The developers, while maintaing the proposal is fully compliant with the plan, argue it could be changed to avoid any non-compliance rather than refused.
The development as it stands involves several stages, including a service station, childcare centre and 39 townhouses.
More than 120 public submissions were made during the consultation period, most objecting to the proposal as too big and inappropriate for the site.
BCC opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the council needed to buy the land to protect koalas.
"[Lord mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting ratepayer funds in a developer court battle and buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife," Cr Cassidy said.
"This is one of the most significant pieces of habitat in the Mountain to Mangroves Corridor and is home to a large koala community."
Cr Schrinner this week said the council wanted to see the koala habitat on the site protected.
"We didn't believe the proposal was appropriate for the site," Cr Schrinner said.
"This, I understand, is now going through a court process and obviously we hope to see out of that court process a good, positive outcome which will see the habitat preserved."
Cr Schrinner said koala habitat mapping was a joint responsibility between the council and the state government, with the state government responsible for detailed koala mapping used by local authorities for assessing development applications.
Solskjær: The next step is winning something
Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær was understandably very happy with the team securing a third-place position in the Premier League today.
This means that the team will play in the UEFA Champions League next season.
United needed a draw or win against Leicester today, and the result was a 2-0 victory for the Red Devils.
"Reaching third place was a great achievement for the players considering how the situation has been during the season.
I think that me and the boys may have overcome a mental block by winning such a big game, considering our two semi-final losses this season.
We knew that we needed good results today, and now we can begin our next chapter which for these boys means winning titles," added Solskjær, pleased with the victory.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title this season, as the team plays in the Europa League in August and has practically secured a spot in the quarter-final.
Cease-fire in war-torn eastern Ukraine to begin at midnight
KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and rebel forces in war-torn eastern Ukraine have started preparing for a "full and comprehensive" cease-fire scheduled to begin at midnight, a move that officials hope can lead to more steps to resolve the 6-year-old conflict.
Rebel officials said Sunday they have instructed their troops about the cease-fire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.
Ukraine's military said their forces "have begun preparations" for the ceasefire.
If upheld, it would "pave the way for implementing other clauses" of the Minsk peace deal, the office of Ukraine's president said earlier this week, calling the cease-fire a "breakthrough."
Brokered in 2015 by France and Germany, the Minsk peace plan aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists.
The conflict has since killed more than 14,000.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both commended the cease-fire deal in a phone call Sunday and underscored the importance of implementing the agreements reached at the December summit in Paris.
Russia President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kyiv's calls to revise the Minsk agreements and said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's "position about the non-alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, once again voiced during this call, should translate into real actions," the Kremlin said.
Zelenskiy in turn, stressed the need "for further practical steps" aimed at releasing Ukrainians who are imprisoned by rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the annexed region of Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement by his office.
The 2015 deal envisaged that Ukraine can regain control over its border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections.
The accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities, but Ukrainian forces and the rebels have continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire.
In December, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris for another round of talks, expressing support for the Minsk deal and agreeing to revive the peace process.
Zelenskiy, who won the 2019 election on promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to get control of its border first before local elections, but the Kremlin has insisted the deal should be implemented without revisions.
The new cease-fire deal was reached Wednesday by members of the Tripartite Contact Group that includes representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was welcomed by EU officials.
During his traditional Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also commended the cease-fire, adding that it needed to be put into practice ″to rebuild confidence and lay the foundations for a much needed and long awaited reconciliation with the people.″
Police: Man fatally shot at protest in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A man was fatally shot at a protest in Texas when he approached a vehicle and the driver inside opened fire, police said.
The shooting happened just before 10 p.m. during a protest in Austin, police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told reporters early Sunday.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
The vehicle had honked, turned down a road and then sped toward protesters, witness Michael Capochiano told the Austin American-Statesman.
The man, who Capochiano said was carrying a rifle, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Initial reports indicated "the victim may have been carrying a rifle," Ratliff told reporters, adding that the suspect was detained and was cooperating with police.
The crowd gathered Saturday for a Black Lives Matter protest, news outlets reported.
The demonstration was streamed live on Facebook and captured audio of a vehicle's horn honking and several gunshots being fired.
A torrent of goals in Breiðablik's first win in July
Breiðablik won its first league victory since 29 June when the team won ÍA, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max Men's League at Kópavogsvöllur tonight.
Meanwhile, ÍA lost its third league match in a row.
After winning their first three league games, Breiðablik went five matches without a win and had lost three matches in a row before the match against ÍA tonight.
So it was do or die for the Breiðablik team, which began the game with great energy.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðarson put the team ahead with a nice finish in the 11th minute after Kristinn Steindórsson had sent him through ÍA's defence.
Kristinn doubled the lead six minutes later after a particularly nice assist from the left wing by Gísli Eyjólfsson.
ÍA couldn't catch a break in the first half, as the home teams' relentless pressure made it enormously difficult for them to connect passes.
Breiðablik ruled the pitch completely and added their third goal in the 36th minute when Danish player Thomas Mikkelsen scored a header following Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corner.
Just three minutes later, Kristinn Steindórsson scored his second goal, the fourth for Breiðablik.
But the story of the first half did not end there.
ÍA gained a sliver of hope before the second half when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty just before half-time, following Kwima Quee's clumsy foul on Viktor Jónsson in Breiðablik's penalty area.
This meant that Breiðablik lead by 4-1 at half-time.
The second half was only three minutes old when ÍA scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was alone and unguarded in Breiðablik's goal area and guided Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson's corner effortlessly into the net.
However, Hlynur committed a foul in ÍA's penalty area only three minutes later, when he fouled Alexander Helgi.
A penalty kick was awarded and Thomas Mikkelsen scored confidentially to give Breiðablik a 5-2 lead when only seven minutes of the second half had passed.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, ÍA scored again.
Breiðablik goal keeper Anton Ari Einarsson was under pressure from Viktor Jónsson and passed the ball to Viktor's foot, from where it bounced into the net.
The score was an incredible 5-3 less than ten minutes into the second half, after which the goal-scoring slowed down.
Despite good chances for more goals by both teams, including two very close ones from Breiðablik's Kwame Quee, no more were scored, making the results a 5-3 victory for Breiðablik.
With this, Breiðablik won its first match in almost a month, since 29 June. The victory puts the team in third place with 14 points, two points away from Valur in second place and three points away from KR in first place.
However, both KR and Valur have played one less match than Breiðablik.
ÍA must accept its third league loss in a row and now has ten points in eighth place, five points from being relegated.
Paw Patrol not at risk despite White House comments
The producers of Paw Patrol reaffirmed yesterday that there were no immediate plans to cancel the children's series.
The statement was made in response to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany's comments that the series, whose protagonists include police dogs, was a victim of cancel culture.
The series' Canadian producers were quick to react to McEny's words by saying that the fans need not worry about Paw Patrol's future.
Recently, a number of television series dealing with police work have been cancelled in the United States, following the wave of protests against police brutality.
Paw Patrol is not one of them, however, despite rumours to the contrary on social media.
In the White House press briefing on Friday, McEnany stated that President Trump was opposed to cancel culture, especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to situations where the comments or actions of individuals or corporations spark a harsh reaction on social media, with calls for the party in question to be boycotted as a sign of protest.
"We saw a few weeks ago that Paw Patrol, a children's show about cops, was cancelled.
The same goes for the shows Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
She added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego had halted the sales of their police sets, but that statement has no basis in fact, according to Lego spokesmen.
Reality series Cops and Live PD were recently cancelled in the United States, however.
Both series have been criticised for showing actual police footage without obtaining permission from the people shown.
Together for 29 years - Occasional jealousy and suspicion
Family therapist Kristín Tómasdóttir answers questions from readers about family matters, children and love in DV's Family Corner.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We don't know anything other than being together, and we feel fine, although we have both felt like we're missing out on something.
We have never been with any other people and have no comparison as to how things could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust about whether the other party is considering other options, thinking about an affair or even a divorce, or about moving on.
When we talk about this, we agree that we should tend to our relationship, but this is something that weighs constantly on us.
Do you have any advice?
Thanks for a great question, and I'm so happy that you have such honest communications that allow you to discuss your complex feelings about the relationship.
It would give me cause for concern if you were thinking this by yourselves, couldn't discuss it and might even take some steps that you would regret later.
Everything out in the open, isn't that always best?
A strong individual identity has the best predictive value for future happiness, so the stronger identity you have, the more likely you are to have a spouse with a strong identity.
The reason why teenage relationships don't last forever is usually that people grow apart, but when there is a synergistic effect, the individuals can create an unusually strong whole.
As the connection between you began to take shape in your formative years, it may be concluded that you have developed together and had a positive effect on each other's identity.
The fact is that we are shaped by our relationships.
The way I talk is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I display myself depends on the way you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn the question around and think: what do we have that others don't?
What do we gain from these years of uniqueness?
I think I can say with certainty that there may be considerably more advantages than drawbacks.
You have shaped each other for years so you might be said to be customised for each other, up to the millimetre.
That is more than many others can say.
Worth it?
You say that you feel you have missed out on something, but it is important to remember that big changes, such as divorce and a new relationship, also have side effects that you may not find too attractive.
You could be missing out on a fresh start, learning to be alone again, getting to know someone new and assembling a family.
This brings about new challenges, different kinds of problems and possibly something new and exciting.
But this is not only blue skies and happiness, oh no, at your age, this can be one heck of a complex project that may never click in the way that you already have with each other.
Is it worth it?
Wouldn't it be better to focus on what you can do to increase the excitement, unpredictability and novelty in your relationship?
You are not retired.
You can do so many things to make your long relationship even deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with it?
What do you need from your spouse that you're not getting?
What can you give your spouse that you've never provided before?
You may have to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
There is considerably more tolerance today towards different relationship forms, and couples are beginning to define their relationship in various ways, e.g. an open relationship or polyamory, or deciding to break up temporarily.
I'm definitely not telling you what to do, as I'm no expert in what solutions would suit you, but it might lift this great weight off you to face the problem and think in solutions.
What do you need to make the distrust and fear go away?
You have been together for 29 years, which must mean that you're capable of doing various things together.
Use that as a strength and find your solution together.
We encourage readers to e-mail their questions and comments to Kristín at: hjonabandssaela@gmail.com.
Questions will then be answered here in the Family Corner, anonymously of course and in full confidentiality.
Dropped the trophy and smashed it to pieces
Despite Branislav Ivanovic's long experience in lifting trophies and celebrating titles, he dropped and broke a beautiful trophy when celebrating his Russian Cup win yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008–2017 before returning to Russia and joining Zenit.
With them, he has now become Russian champion two years in a row and yesterday, the team won the Russian Cup in a 1-0 victory over Khimki, with Artem Dzyuba scoring the winning penalty in the 84th minute.
The Russian Cup trophy is made of glass so when Zenit captain Ivanovic dropped it to the ground, it broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his team were unfazed and continued partying into the night.
It's really war!
Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's barrister for her Wagatha Christie battle with Rebekah Vardy
Mrs Rooney has asked David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy
After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday understands that Mrs Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy with allegations that personal information was leaked from her private Instagram account to a newspaper.
The news comes days after documents submitted to the High Court claimed that Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physical and mental anguish as a result of Mrs Rooney's allegations.
The papers say the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave the house," adding that Mrs Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was taken to hospital three times... as she suffered anxiety attacks as a result of the post and the repercussions of it."
As well as representing Depp in his libel action against The Sun over allegations the actor was a wife-beater, Mr Sherborne, 50, is acting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their privacy claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.
"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.
"It really is war now. Coleen will not back down, neither will Becky. It will be sensational stuff."
Mrs Rooney claimed that someone using Mrs Vardy's Instagram account had leaked fake stories about her to a newspaper.
She was nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she had she spent five months slowly limiting the number of friends who could see her updates on Instagram stories until only Mrs Vardy's account remained.
Mrs Rooney claims she then posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a red-top newspaper.
In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."
But Mrs Rooney's team has challenged the claim, alleging that details of her anguish are a "PR exercise" that distracts from the facts.
A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."
Mrs Rooney - who has four sons with former England star Wayne Rooney - is being represented by lawyer Paul Lunt, of Liverpool-based legal firm Brabners.
Mrs Vardy is with London company Kingsley Napley, but it is unclear if she has yet instructed a barrister.
A spokesman for Mrs Rooney declined to comment.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.
The answer to that question - at least for now - we may never know.
Wallace on Sunday informed viewers that the Biden campaign told Fox News he was "not available" for an interview.
"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter," Wallace said.
"This week, we asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available."
He added, "We'll keep asking every week."
The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.
While Biden recently has returned to the stump, Trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for "hiding" in his home in Delaware.
Biden's reticence to do public events, however, has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had Biden comfortably ahead of Trump both nationally and in key battleground states.
Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.
Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.
The latest Fox News Polls put Biden ahead in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with leads all outside the margin of error.
Polling also suggested Biden had a slight edge in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important swing states this cycle.
And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the White House are often a referendum on that president - and that's seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden.
The top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic - and the president's performance and record on both issues.
Kanye West and his struggle with bipolar disorder
Today, musician Kanye West apologised to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for remarks he made during a manic episode.
The chair of the Icelandic Mental Health Alliance believes the bipolar disorder to be the source of his creativity but a psychiatrist says that it is important for people to take medication to contain the condition.
Rapper Kanye West is not only famous for being one of the most original and influential musicians of our times, but also for being the husband of reality television star Kim Kardashian.
His private life has largely been conducted in public.
His statement earlier this month that he intended to run for President of the United States, and his emotional and incoherent speech on that occasion, was widely reported.
He later posted several bizarre tweets, including claims that his wife was trying to have him committed to a hospital.
Kim Kardashian then posted a statement on Instagram asking people to be understanding towards her husband and the family; he was bipolar and it was difficult for his loved ones to help him if he refused to seek help himself.
He has since offered a public apology to her.
This famous family isn't alone in dealing with this problem.
It's estimated that around one percent of the population experience bipolar disorder.
Ferdinand Jónsson, the senior physician of a mental health team at a London hospital, is very familiar with the condition.
"This condition can create such enormous trouble for the individuals and particularly their families and loved ones.
This mania can destroy relationships and work and cause enormous sorrow.
Then there's the other side, the depression, which is often highly dangerous because there's a high rate of suicides in this group.
So I thought it was beautiful of her to say this.
And that's just human and humane," says Ferdinand.
Héðinn Unnsteinsson, the chair of the Icelandic Mental Health Alliance, has himself dealt with bipolar disorder — and is a fan of Kanye West: "He seems to have a very active imagination.
If we are ordinary four-string double basses, he's a hundred-string celestial harp.
And he's so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and obviously deep into his powerful connective thinking, because you become aware of this connective thinking that we who have experienced manic episodes know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take antipsychotics as he believes they will reduce his creativity.
He has dealt publicly with his bipolar disorder, including on the album Ye.
Héðinn says that it's his choice not take medication.
"Many feel that it restricts the creative element of this unrestrained connective thinking and enormous fiery creative energy that it has, but there are drawbacks of course; frequent pain and lows, dim cellars and darkness."
However, Ferdinand says that it's important for people with bipolar disorder to receive treatment.
"If you're experiencing enormous mania, you're not producing anything great, you're just totally wild.
And when people enter into a serious depression, the situation completely paralyses them," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Absolutely," says Ferdinand.
"And especially to work with someone to find the right dozes and a way to create a balance between the medication helping him to the fullest extent while spoiling as little as possible for him, his talent and his creativity."

Delhi Metro Casts First Pier Under Phase-4 Work
The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.
The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation took another important step forward in its Phase 4 construction work as the first pier of this phase of Metro expansion was cast on the Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg Metro corridor," the DMRC said in a statement.
This "major construction milestone" has been achieved, despite severe shortage of manpower and other logistical challenges because of the pandemic, officials said.
The average height of piers on this corridor is 10m.
However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct level is going to be at 28m, the highest in the history of Delhi Metro, the statement said.
Presently, the highest point is at Dhaula Kuan, where the Line 7 viaduct passes at a height of 23.6m.
Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.
They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.
Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.
Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.
The 28.92-km-long Janakpuri West-R K Ahsram Marg corridor is an extension of Magenta Line and will come up with 22 stations.
While 21.18 km of this corridor will be elevated, 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction work on this particular section had started in December last year.
On July 17, the work on the underground section of this corridor was commenced with the beginning of D Wall construction work at the Krishna Park Extension Metro station.
On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.
Under Phase-4, 61.679 km of new metro lines shall be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 metro stations.
These new sections shall provide interconnectivity among the already operational sections of Delhi Metro.
Out of this, 22.35 km will be underground while rest will be elevated.

"Paranoid" ambassador wants gun, armoured car and stab-proof vest - called subordinates agents of the "Deep State"
According to a CBS News report today, the politically appointed US Ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, wants to carry a firearm.
The opening words of the CBS report read: "Despite being assigned to one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been "paranoid" about his security since coming to Reykjavik last year."
CBS's sources are 12 diplomats, government officials and former officials, as well as individuals familiar with the situation.
Gunter's conclusion was to demand that the US State Department obtain permission for the paranoid ambassador to carry arms in Iceland.
He is also said to have requested an armoured car to transport him from one place to another in Iceland, and a stab-proof vest.
The US State Department declined to say if there is any threat to the ambassador's safety, although US government officials said that the ambassador had been informed that Iceland is a safe country and that he is safe.
Despite this, jobs listings for bodyguards were placed in Icelandic newspapers, according to CBS, which was part of meeting the ambassador's demands.
According to CBS's report, the Iceland Ministry for Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the matter to CBS.
However, the American news agency quoted its Icelandic sources as saying that no such request had been received by Icelandic authorities.
CBS adds that Gunter had been talked out of walking around armed because it would offend the host nation, Iceland.
The ambassador received his position as a reward for his generous contributions to Donald Trump's campaign fund in the 2016 presidential election.
Before that, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since taking over in May, Gunter is said to have created an "untenable" working environment, having already gone trough seven immediate subordinates, so-called Deputy Chiefs of Mission, who are the ambassador's second in command as well as being posted diplomats.
These were all experienced diplomats from the US State Department.
The ambassador sent the first one away because he "didn't like the look of him".
He had already prepared for a whole year and learnt Icelandic.
The second lasted only six months.
A staff rotation system was subsequently set up, with the idea of Gunter trying out as many people as possible until he found someone he liked.
CBS furthermore claims that Gunter accused embassy staff of acting on behalf of the "Deep State" and undermining his relationship with the State Department in Washington DC.
State Department leadership in Washington is said to be well aware of the situation in their Reykjavík embassy, but be reluctant to take charge of the chaos at the embassy in light of Gunter's connections to the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had difficulty following orders from the State Department in Washington, and to have refused to return to DC while the Covid-19 pandemic was raging.
He left the embassy in the charge of his staff for many months.
He is said to have intended to work remotely from his home in California unless ordered to return by the State Minister himself, Mike Pompeo.
Finally came back
Having finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new Deputy Chief of Mission, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their enquiries to the US State Department.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not want to offer any comments to CBS, nor to DV's enquiry.
Gunter is one of many of the Trump administration's politically appointed ambassadors to be noted for their unusual behaviour in recent months.
Woody Johnson was harshly criticised, for example, when it was revealed that he had attempted to get the British Open moved to a Trump-owned golf course.
The ambassador to South Africa has also been criticised for dismissing her Deputy Chief of Mission and then trying to appoint her son to the post.
42% of US ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed under Obama's government and 32% under George W. Bush's government.
Seattle protesters clash with police over Trump's 'surge' of federal agents plan
Police in Seattle used flashbang grenades and pepper spray on Saturday against protesters who set fire to construction trailers outside a youth jail, amid a wave of public anger over President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into major cities.
The sounds of repeated small detonations rang out in the streets of the city in Washington state, and smoke rose from an area where demonstrators had set fire to trailers by a construction site for the youth detention facility.
Demonstrators slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows.
Police in riot gear faced off against the demonstrators, some of whom held up umbrellas against falling pellets of pepper spray.
The Seattle Times newspaper quoted police as saying 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assault against officers, obstruction and failure to disperse.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty aimed at preventing violence towards women
Poland's right-wing government says it will withdraw from a European treaty aimed at preventing violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the world's first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as "harmful" because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.
Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty.
"This ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, convictions of the young Polish generation of students to make, in our opinion, the false assumption that biological sex is archaic, and in fact everything comes down to the socio-cultural gender."
In Ziobro's opinion, the convention's articles concerning the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the LGBT context are not acceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT element of promoting family relationships, a view propagated by activists from left-wing or homosexual circles who want to translate their beliefs into binding law," he said.
The Council of Europe said on Sunday it is "alarmed" that Poland is aiming to withdraw from the Convention.
In Warsaw on Friday, around 2,000 people including women's groups and other rights activists held a demonstration in front of the offices of Ordo Luris, a right-wing organisation that supports withdrawal from the convention.
"We will not be victims" they chanted.
Demonstrations were also held in other Polish cities.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, Hall of Fame engine builder, dies at 81
KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a stock car racing dynasty that includes father Lee and brother Richard and the first engine builder to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, died Saturday.
He was 81.
Petty's family did not disclose the cause of death.
No funeral arrangements have been announced.
While other family members were acclaimed for their ability behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Chief" for his ability to turn a wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven championships in NASCAR's premier series, and he also built engines that carried Hall of Famer Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton to victory.
"The Chief was one of the most talented mechanics in NASCAR history," chairman and chief executive Jim France.
"He provided the power that helped Petty Enterprises define dominance in sports.
While he was known for his work under the hood, Maurice played multiple behind-the-scenes roles, doing what it took to help deliver his cars to victory lane."
Maurice Petty was born March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He would tail his father to the track while growing up, and his mechanical know-how soon played an integral part in Lee Petty winning 54 races and three championships.
He made 26 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1960-64, finishing in the top 5 seven times with 16 top-10 runs.
But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.
Richard, who would take on the nickname "The King," won his first championship along with The Chief when he drove a Plymouth to the 1964 title.
They won again in 1967, back-to-back titles in 1970 and "71, and added three more before the 1970s drew to an end.
The seven titles remains tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the most in history.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers in NASCAR who helped build one of NASCAR's dominant teams in Petty Enterprises," Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley said in a statement.
"Although the record shows 212 victories, Petty has well over 250 wins to his credit considering all the engines he built for his competitors.
Chief will forever be remember as one of the best to build power plants in NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, Patricia, died in 2014.
He also was the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyle Petty and Truck Series crew chief Trent Owens.
"While we have lost one of NASCAR's true, gritty pioneers and heroes, Maurice Petty's legacy and memory will always be remembered, preserved, celebrated and cherished," Kelley said.
"We offer our sincere condolences to the Petty family."
"Earned himself" a continued stay in a holding cell
The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police had its hands quite full today.
One of the police's tasks was arresting a man by the police station at Hverfisgata this morning.
The man had been released from a holding cell a short while earlier but refused to leave, came back again and again and did not follow the police's order to leave.
"He earned himself a continued stay with the police," reads the police diary.
Other police tasks included a notification of assault in Breiðholt between 10 and 11 this morning, which required police to get involved with two men.
Police also had to get involved with a woman in a Kópavogur shopping mall who had eaten there but didn't have money to pay the bill.
Average US gas price up a penny over 2 weeks to $2.25/gallon
CAMARILLO, Calif. -- The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline inched up less than penny over the past two weeks to $2.25 per gallon.
That's 56 cents below the average pump price from a year ago.
Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday it's the smallest rise in prices seen since late April.
She said crude oil prices have remained stable and there's an abundant supply of U.S. gasoline to meet the demand.
Nationwide, the highest average price for regular-grade gas is in the San Francisco Bay Area at $3.27 per gallon.
The lowest average is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at $1.79 per gallon.
The average price of diesel in the survey taken Friday held steady from two weeks earlier at $2.54 a gallon.
Pedro Chelsea exit confirmed as team-mates 'serenade' forward in changing room send-off
Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has paid tribute to winger Pedro Rodriguez after making his final league appearance for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old penned a short-term extension to his contract to see out the season with the club but will join AS Roma on a free transfer upon the conclusion of the campaign.
The Spain international, who arrived from Barcelona back in 2015, has played a bit-part role under Lampard this season with only eight Premier League starts and 21 appearances in all competitions.
The Blues boss confirmed Pedro's departure after the west London club sealed a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Wolves, with the veteran coming off the bench for his final appearance.
"Pedro has played his last game for the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.
"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.
"It was his last Premier League game, but the impact he has had here is huge.
I want to say a big thanks to Peds and wish him well as he goes forward.
"He is here for the remainder of games, but a big player of the club leaves and the spirit of the club I saw afterwards was pretty special."
Pedro tweeted a farewell message after the game via his Twitter account, writing: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
Thanks to every fan for your support through these years, to the club for giving me the chance of being a Blue and to my team-mates.
You'll be in my heart forever.
Now let's fight for the FA Cup trophy!!!
BIG BLUE FAMILY."
The former Barcelona forward leaves after helping Chelsea since the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte and also won the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
Earned himself another arrest
This morning, a man was arrested for the second time in a brief span of time when he refused to leave the police station after having been released from custody.
The man was arrested for drunk driving last night and detained in a holding cell overnight.
When he was released this morning, he refused to leave and came back several times, according to the police.
He did not follow the police's repeated orders to leave, so he "earned himself" an extension of his stay with the police, to quote the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Diary.
Restaurants that maintain the 2-metre rule
It's highly amusing to see how restaurants maintain the two-metre rule to keep open and follow all the rules that have been set.
Here are a few photos from around the world, where the mood is a little bit different from what we see in our country.
Troops destroy bandits' camp, eliminate bandits in Zamfara State
The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.
The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.
Major General Enenche said the HUMINT established that members of the gang, along with their logistics items, motorcycles and hundreds of rustled livestock, had relocated from their erstwhile position to the new area by a rocky high ground within the Forest.
Enenche said the Air Component, therefore, dispatched an enhanced force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location.
According to him "the attack aircraft engaged the target area scoring accurate hits and taking out some of the bandits.
Many others, who were seen trying to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks."
While commending the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of airstrikes against armed bandits.
The Chief of the Air Staff tasked them to continue to provide close air support for the ongoing ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits and restore normalcy to the North-West and North-Central zones of the Country.
First suspected Coronavirus infection in North Korea
The state news agency of North Korea reported last night that the first COVID-19 infection in the country had probably been diagnosed.
According to the report, the infected person is a man who fled the country three years ago but returned to North Korea last week.
The man was diagnosed in the border city of Kaesong, which has now been isolated and a curfew imposed on its residents.
North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un held an emergency meeting with senior officials to decide how to respond to these concerning news.
According to a State Television report, Kim ordered "maximum security measures" to prevent the spread of the virus.
He also ordered an investigation of how the man could travel undetected across the heavily guarded border between the two Korean states, and warned that those responsible could expect "harsh punishment".

Serbia seeks more warplanes amid Balkan tensions
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the Balkans, the Serbian president said Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain initiatives" have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the U.S. and other Western countries of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.
"The Americans, Turks and Germans are taking care of their beloved child," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said the U.S. has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to Kosovo's security forces.
During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with "NATO donations" to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, "therefore we must do it alone."
Vucic did not specify what type of warplanes Serbia plans to buy, but the pro-government media said his government has officially asked the U.S. for the delivery of 20 fighter-bombers.
The reports said Washington has not yet responded to Belgrade's request and that in case of a refusal, it is likely to purchase Russian-made Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft.
Serbia, which claims military neutrality, has recently received a sophisticated anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
Another Serbian ally, China, has delivered military drones.
U.S. officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against Serbia if Moscow sends more arms to the country, especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring NATO-member states.
The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia's neighbors.
Tensions are growing in the Balkans, which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s.
NATO intervened in Serbia to stop a bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the Kremlin, as well as Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, don't accept Kosovo's independence, which is recognized by the U.S. and most of the West.
Heart attack: Eating chocolate once a week may reduce risk of the deadly condition
New research has pinpointed a certain indulgence may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it? And how would it reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis spanning five decades looking into coronary heart disease (CHD).
CHD - that also goes by the name of ischaemic heart disease - has three main symptoms: chest pain (angina), heart attacks and heart failure.
Other symptoms of the disease can include heart palpitations and unusual breathlessness.
"Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, otherwise known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), collects "bad" cholesterol - the kind that furs up the heart's arteries - and transports it to the liver.
In the liver, "bad" (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body.
However, the new study doesn't examine portion sizes, or the type of chocolate enjoyed.
It's not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or some other cocoa confectionery.
The findings were based on previous research that concluded that consuming cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
It's believed by scientists the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how effectively the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries away waste material.
In regards to the new research, lifestyle factors weren't highlighted in the results.
Dr Alice Lichtenstein commented on the data, suggesting that those who admitted to eating chocolate may be more likely to have "a healthy body weight."
She added that they could "regularly engage" in physical exercise and be "less stressed."
She continued: "Each factor could independently impact on cardiovascular health."
Coles ditches plastic toys for books in new collectibles campaign
"We've really listened, and it was a really key thing in formulating this program," Ms Ronson said.
"We don't think people will want to recycle the books - we think they'll want to keep them, but they can recycle them at home if they wish to."
Ms Ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she believed the timing was "quite good" for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children.
Analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets, but Ms Ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet.
"We're not seeing any of that so far, but we do constantly look out for it," she said.
"We analyse a lot of data, week to week, month to month, to make sure we're launching things that really resonate with the customer base."
Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.
Woolworths has since followed suit with its Lion King Ooshies campaign, which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales, and most recently, its eco-friendly Discovery Garden promotion, which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant.
However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.
Ms Ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future, with promotions such as Little Shop likely to appear less often.
"There's a lot of these collectible-type campaigns to look to around the world, and we're constantly drawing inspiration from overseas," she said.
"We should be doing those sorts of things to make sure we're constantly raising the bar with our own customer base."
Has taken 5 trips around the country this summer
Photographer and content creator Jón Ragnar Jónsson, who is often referred to as Jon From Iceland, has mostly been travelling around Iceland since the onset of the pandemic.
Jón completed his undergraduate studies in business administration at Reykjavik University several years ago and now makes a living travelling and producing marketing material for individuals and companies.
The summer began early for Jón, or in early April, when he travelled across the entire Westfjords, sleeping in his car.
He has already made five or six trips around the country this year.
He has also gone on countless day trips to various destinations.
Which trip stands out?
"It is difficult to name a favourite place for someone like me, who is constantly travelling and has seen everything.
The most important things are the weather and the company.
I've recently travelled a lot to the highlands, after the roads there were opened in June.
These trips are always highlights because it's such an adventure to reach your destination.
The last trip there, when 25 of us travelled in 5 large trucks to Fljótshlíð and from there to Álftavatn, may be my favourite trip of the year."
What are your plans for the summer?
"There are many exciting things ahead. I just completed a diving course with DIVE so now there'll be diving trips all over Iceland.
I also added a surfboard to my "toy box" so I'll spend more time in the sea than before.
Then I'm planning a 10-day "solo" trip with everything I need on my back, but it will become clear what my destination will be later this summer.
Anyway, I will mainly stay in the highlands in the near future since you can't explore that area year-round.
What place in Iceland is your favourite?
"I always find it difficult to pick one place, but Jökulsárlón has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
The family went to a summer cottage by the roots of Breiðamerkurjökull and I've always felt good in this area since then.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there more than a 100 times."
Which place in Iceland would you encourage people to visit?
"I'm going to name one jewel from each part of the country, these being: Múlagljúfur in South Iceland, Stuðlagil in East Iceland, Aldeyjarfoss in North Iceland, Rauðasandur in the Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in West Iceland, and last but not least... Mælifell in the highlands."
What's essential when you're travelling?
"I don't leave the city unless I have the following in my car: A good flashlight, hammock, wool sweater, hunting knife, fire logs, cooling box and Æði chocolate... those who know me know what I'm talking about."
Malaysia searches for 24 Rohingya feared drowned off island
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysian authorities said Sunday that they were searching for two dozen Rohingya refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping off their boat off the northern resort island of Langkawi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, said initial police information showed that only one of 25 Rohingya men who jumped off the boat had managed to swim ashore.
The lone survivor sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained for further investigation, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad.
Zawawi said two vessels and an aircraft were deployed in the search.
He said the agency will also alert local fishermen and authorities in neighboring Thailand to assist in the search.
He didn't provide further details on the boat.
Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off Langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn't be turned back to sea.
The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said those already in the country will not be sent back out to sea.
Malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers - including 101,000 Rohingya - who are registered with the U.N. refugee agency.
Aswan villagers collect, guard and return crashed chocolate shipment to Sudan
A truck loaded with tons of chocolate headed to Sudan rolled over on the Aswan-Abu Simple International Road on Sunday, in front of Wadi Karkar Village entrance, with the driver falling into a coma brought on by heatstroke.
Villagers rushed to the scene to attend to the fallen driver and retrieve the fallen shipments.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his view that the driver was "a passerby in front of our village; we could not leave him alone.
We should help anyone, whatever their identity, if they are in distress."
He added that the villagers brought an ambulance to retrieve the driver, and then attempted to retrieve the truck's goods, estimated to be worth three million LE.
According to Bahr, the villagers stayed at the scene from morning to night retrieving as many shipments as they could.
"The most important thing for us was to save the driver's life, protect the shipment, and open up the international road," he explained.
The villagers were more than ready to bring water and shelter the injured driver, Bahr said, adding that all they wanted was to ensure that he would enter and leave the village safely.
Congress Was Already Broken. The Coronavirus Could Make It Worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis," says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.
"But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation's original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding."
The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.
It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.
If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.
"Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why," the report said.
"But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue."
The document says Congress needs "more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress.
They need to learn more about each other's districts, hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground, build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions."
In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.
Rep. Val Demings talks VP candidacy, blasts Trump for pardons
Congresswoman Val Demings (D-Fla.) was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential Joe Biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role.
In a live interview with BlackPressUSA as part of its #FIYAH! Live series, the esteemed member of the Congressional Black Caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point, stating, "You all know my history. I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida."
Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.
The former House Impeachment Manager, replied in a February interview with NPR from her Capitol Hill office, "Was it worth it? Every day it has been worth it."
Adding, while the verdict was disappointing, Democrats had an obligation to pursue the case regardless of outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she objects to Trump commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other felonies) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, stating, "The gall of pardoning your friends, those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings."
Demings heads Biden's list of potential running mates along with CBC Chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and a few others.
She noted however, that just one person will decide who will run alongside Joe Biden this fall.
"That's Joe Biden."
Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."
There's no doubt that regardless of one's political leanings, history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in American politics and perceptions.
This fact was not lost on Demings.
She noted that having so any women in consideration for vice presidential candidacy represents an opportunity to break through what remains of the glass ceiling - particularly when it comes to African American women.
"These are the exact opportunities that I work hard for all of my life to create for young boys and girls who may have been told they're the wrong color, don't have enough money, or are the wrong gender," she said.
The congresswoman pledged to make sure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign advertise and to work with the Black Press of America to get as many as possible out to vote.
"I will make a call to [DNC Head] Tom Perez and I will put this on the top of my list," Demings promised.
She agreed it should be done now, rather than later in the campaign.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."
"But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates the job.
It's not a job where you should be allowed to break the law and ignore the Constitution.
I think he hates the job, but he hates to lose.
I can see this president not wanting to leave the White House, but we have a way of taking care of that, and if that happens, I just want to be on the team that makes it happen."

Alibaba, Jack Ma summoned by Gurugram court on former employee's complaint
Gurugram, July 26: In a major development, Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma has been summoned by a Gurugram court after the company's former employee alleged that he was fired for objecting censorship and fake news on company's applications.
The case is filed in Gurugram district court and Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen others, and has asked them to appear on July 29, as per reports.
The judge has also sought written responses from the company, Reuters reported.
Parmar, who was an employee of the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is seeking $268,000 in damages, according to court documents.
"We are unwavering in its commitment to the Indian market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws.
We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation," UC India stated in a statement.
"The lawsuit also contains a "sensitive words list" with key words in Hindi and English like "India-China border" and "Sino-India war" that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India," Reuters reported.
Last month, the Home Ministry had banned 59 Chinese mobile apps including UC News, UC Browser amidst border tensions between the two countries.
FDNY diversity official says 'most definitely' OK to exclude white firefighter from color guard
An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Lt. Daniel McWilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flag-bearing unit at a November 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternal society of black firefighters.
And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.
McWilliams was one of the three FDNY firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the American flag at Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks.
According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.
Being a flag bearer at the event was an 'esteemed honor and privilege' for McWilliams, according to his lawsuit, CNN reported.
Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.
She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year FDNY veteran - to 'help in a different capacity.'
Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.
McWilliams claimed in his suit that he asked Wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because he's not black.
She confirmed that was the case, he said.
Wilson, a 21-year FDNY veteran who was also part of the 9/11 rescue efforts, apparently replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claimed he left the memorial 'to save himself from further shame, humiliation and embarrassment,' as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues, the New York Daily News reported.
During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'
'No, it isn't,' Loving said, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'
By way of explanation, Loving said that it was OK to swap out a white person for a black person to 'uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another.'
McWilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the FDNY in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the FDNY, the city of New York and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
After filing his complaint, Sullivan said that McWilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by Wilson's supporters.
At one point, one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on McWilliams and said: 'I've heard about you, they told me you'd act this way, and now you know me.'
In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.
'If you're black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a slap on the wrist at best,' Sullivan wrote.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, received 'one hour of counseling' over her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives 'heavy-handed discipline and punishment,' Sullivan wrote.
'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.
Threatened a pedestrian and demanded money
A man was arrested in the town centre after an attempted robbery where he tried to threaten a pedestrian into handing over money.
The man was detained in a holding cell.
The police also received a notification of a man with a knife in the town centre.
The knife was confiscated and a statement taken from the man in question.
The police dealt with approximately eighty matters between 5 PM and 5 AM and six people had been detained in a holding cell this morning.
Police stopped the driver of a vehicle towing a caravan, as the caravan's running gear was in very poor condition.
The caravan was grounded and the owner said he would get a means of transport to move it to town.
The police also stopped drug manufacturing operations in Árbær.
Two were arrested in connection with the case and released after having their statements taken.
There was also a notification of people lighting fireworks in Árbær.
They had fled the scene by the time police arrived "as they probably knew they were not in the right, considering how far off New Year's Eve is."
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Putin's resignation
Thousands of residents gathered in the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday to protest the arrest of the governor of the region of the same name in southern East Russia, and the appointment of his replacement, who has never lived in the region.
Former governor Sergei Furgal is very popular, and tens of thousands of city residents protested when he was detained and taken to Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murders of three businessmen fifteen years ago.
Last week, Furgal was formally removed as governor and replaced by his party colleague, 39 year old Mikhail Degtaryev, much to the displeasure of the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, what's worse, without any connections to Khabarovsk, and the residents of the city called for his immediate resignation.
Degtaryev has completely ignored these calls.
There were almost as many protesters yesterday as in the first protest, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: The release of Furgal and the resignation of President Putin.
"We want the governor released because we believe he was most likely illegally detained," said Alina Sleopova, a protester in her mid-twenties, as quoted by AFP.
She insists that Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested "to protect their own interests rather than the interests of the region."
The Khabarovsk police allowed the protests to continue despite the protest march being a clear violation of the current ban on gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic.
On the other hand, Moscow police arrested at least 10 people who had gathered in Pushkin Square to support protesters in Khabarovsk, according to UK newspaper The Guardian.
Furgal's party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a party of hardline nationalists and analysts consider it to be somewhat supportive of the Kremlin in most matters.
However, the same analysts told the BBC that Furgal's victory in the governor elections — which was clear and decisive — had been a considerable shock for Putin and United Russia, and an indication of the Kremlin's weakening hold on the eastern regions.
Furgal was arrested on 9 July and taken to Moscow where he awaits trial.
He is accused of having ordered three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two were carried out while the third failed.
According to the BBC's Moscow correspondent, Sarah Rainsford, supporters of Furgal, who enjoys great popularity at home, are convinced that the charge and arrest are politically motivated.
They want to know why the authorities didn't arrest him until now, Rainsford says, 15 years after his alleged crimes.
Tree Branches Downed as Hurricane Hanna Passes Through Southern Texas
Hurricane Hanna weakened to a tropical storm after it made landfall on the coast of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but officials warned the storm still had potential to lead to "life-threatening" flash flooding.
The National Weather Service (NWS) said heavy rainfall remained the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this footage on Twitter, and told Storyful he filmed this footage outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Differently-Abled Homeless Women Part Of Chennai's COVID-19 Fight
Shanthi, a differently-abled master tailor, visits 250 homes everyday to identify symptomatic people in Kodambakkam, a key Covid hotspot in Chennai with around 10,000 positive cases.
Her day starts as early as 7:30 AM and finishes at around 4 PM.
She checks the temperature of residents, quizes them for symptoms, and spreads awareness on wearing masks, frequently washing hands, and social distancing.
Her efforts have even helped the early identification and recovery of four positive people.
Shanthi is among Chennai City corporation's 16,000 non-medical workers who conduct door-to-door screening.
The iniative, authorties say, has led to a 50 per cent fall in positive cases in Chennai's daily tally even as they rise in other Tamil Nadu districts.
Shanthi says not all residents are cooperative.
She adds, "Most people cooperate seeing a differently-abled woman reaching out to them.
Some feel irritated too.
I'd not be worried.
For me, people should be safe.
When I visit them again the next day they are polite.
Establishing a good rapport helps."
And there are several others like Shanthi who stay at the corportation's homeless shelter for differently abled women and help in the fight against Covid-19.
Not far away Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also differently-abled, has joined the effort as a supervisor.
Though she has a retrofitted bike, Kavitha walks holding her crutches to meet people.
"I am happy," she says about the decline in numbers, but adds, "I want this to come down to perhaps around 100 a day.
I'm confident we can reach that."
On the ground floor of the homeless shelter where the two stay, Matilda Funceca, a wheelchair basketball player, and Manimekalai, a school teacher, upload all the data sent by around 40 women to Chennai Corporation's server.
Matilda says she has no fear of contracting coronavirus.
"When we help others, God will protect us" she adds.
Asked about the precautions they take, Manimekalai explains: "I wear a mask, follow social distancing and do frequent hand wash.
I also take Kabasura Kudineer, Siddha immunity-boosting drink."
A few months ago, when corona first struck Chennai these differently-abled women used their time and talent to stitch masks for sanitary workers in the city.
Dr Aishwarya Rao, director of the Shelter and Dorcas Research Centre that runs the shelter, said "They adapt according to the need of the hour.
Earlier mask was needed and they rose to the occasion.
Now it's time for community intervention and they readily said yes."
Coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu have crossed the two lakh-mark with 6,989 new cases reported in the last 24 hours, which is also the biggest single-day spike, government data shows.
Eighty-nine have died and 7,758 have recovered in the last 24 hours.
The total cases in the state is now 2,06,737.
Police work on timeline of Helensburgh teenager's final movements
Detectives investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are trying to build a timeline of his final movements.
The body of Kirk Allan, 19, was discovered at an address in Johnson Court at about 06:25 on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and police confirmed on Sunday that he has now been charged in connection with the death.
He is due to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Monday.
Det Insp Steve Martin said: "Our thoughts remain with Kirk's family and friends at this very difficult time.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox Speak On Experiences of Discrimination
Over the last few weeks it has become evident that are many skeletons in relation to racial discrimination in South African sport.
Constructive conversations need to be had and action has to be taken in order to forge more inclusive sports.
Former Proteas batting star Ashwell Prince has lashed out at his former white team mates, accusing them of racial bias by labelling him and other black squad members as "quota players."
Prince said that in the Proteas team black players were openly labelled "quota players" by their white teammates.
Adding that it is sad that even when black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada who ascended to the pinnacle of the game, they still have the quota tag attached to them by some people.
Prince, the current coach of the Cape Cobras franchise, made the comments on a webinar hosted by the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The organisation aims to further the raging conversation of historic racial discrimination in South African sports.
"Like I said in my social media outburst, it's not my idea to come and drag people's names through the mud, but these are real incidents...
"You Do the Right Things, and Still You Get It"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter turned computer programmer for NASA, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a retired Methodist Hospital nurse who calls herself a "glass half full person," ran an online fanzine and attended Comic Con events years ago.
They gather weekly with their two daughters, son-in-law and 7-year-old grandson for jigsaw puzzles and fierce games of Uno.
"They are amazing nerds," Ms. Roman, 38, said of her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, understood the perils of the pandemic - she had diabetes, asthma and heart disease, which could put her at higher risk.
Her husband had chronic lung disease and a stent to open a blocked coronary artery.
"We have been so careful, so very careful, and stayed away from people," Ms. Roberts said.
Her husband began working from home in the spring when Washington State, New York and then other areas around the country were hit hard.
Mr. Roberts occasionally made a supermarket run during "senior" hour; the couple's only "big, hot date" in recent months, Ms. Roberts said, was to view wildflowers from their car.
Their younger daughter was diligent as well.
But then she came back from work sneezing one day in mid-June and thought it was allergies.
Soon she had a cough, fever, headaches and diarrhea, and lost her senses of taste and smell, telltale symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She told me, "I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I wore a mask, I wore gloves, I washed my hands,"" Ms. Roberts said.
"You do the right things, and still you get it."
Elaine Roberts, who tested positive for the coronavirus, did not become seriously ill.
But for her parents, it would be much worse.
Mr. Roberts and his wife started sneezing, then coughing, just like their daughter, and developed fevers and severe body aches.
Then he got "awfully sick, awfully quickly," Sheryl Roberts recalled.
He became confused on June 22.
Alarmed, she tested his oxygen level.
It was low, and she called her older daughter to take him to an emergency care center, the second visit in two days.
Ex-royal couple 'felt snubbed' in Queen's Christmas speech, new book claims
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry "felt snubbed" by his grandmother, The Queen, during her Christmas speech.
The couple's new biography, Finding Freedom, claims they felt left out of the photo collection on show in the festive address.
Pictures on the desk that The Queen was sitting at included Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla along with Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen having welcomed Archie last May - although the youngster did get a mention as Her Majesty's 'eighth great-grandchild'.
The new book - which is set to be released in August - also reveals that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "struggled to move past distant politeness" and they only met up on a few occasions.
It was claimed yesterday that Prince Harry's split with his brother William started years before his romance with Meghan - and that it came to a head over William's marriage to Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt like a "spare part" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton - with it claimed, "long before Meghan he wanted to change things."
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever'
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever' after defying Boris Johnson's call for them to get back into the office
Union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to "stay at home forever" after defying Boris Johnson's clarion call for workers to get back to the office.
Tory MPs reacted with anger after the Public and Commercial Services Union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was "unacceptable" that vital public-sector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis.
"It's unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period," he said.
"Many of those workers would now like a holiday and can't have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely.
"The union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever - especially not now that we know people can return to work safely."
Following the Prime Minister's call, Alex Chisholm, the Civil Service's new chief operating officer, last week told all ministries that it was time to "change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1."
But the Public and Commercial Services Union told its 200,000 members they did not have to accept that guidance, claiming it was a political issue.
A spokesman for the PCS, Britain's largest civil service union, said the back-to-the-office demand "is not based on our members" health and safety, or on helping our economy.
It is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some Tory MPs who are demanding that the Civil Service is used as an example to get everybody back to work.
"Our advice to members is clear: if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work, don't just accept that's what you have to do."
The dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by home-working, with more than 400,000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Home Office has now said it will "seek to expedite" applications from Britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the Passport Office for more than four weeks.
The PCS has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that "small and often cramped offices" make social distancing difficult for the Passport Office's 4,000 staff.
Former Cabinet Minister David Davis urged civil service union chiefs to "behave responsibly" and work with the Government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in Government, he would be asking union leaders: "What are you suggesting? That you stay [at home] all summer?"
However, Mr Johnson's plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of Britain's top firms.
A study of big employers with a total of 400,000 staff between them found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to the workplace.
History focus can play an important role in reconciliation
Divides have deepened when understanding and healing should be our goals.
Our school system is partly to blame for this failure of knowledge and understanding.
Far too little Australian history is taught.
In fact, without radical action, the only school subject that focuses specifically on our history - "Australian history," at year 12 - will die within the next five years, maybe sooner.
Last year, of 49,324 Victorian students to complete the VCE, only 628, or 1 per cent, did Australian history.
Over the past six years, this figure has been almost halved, with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year.
A key reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion.
History is not even a standalone learning area, but is subsumed within the broader "humanities."
So across years 7 and 8, students complete only one short unit on ancient "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture."
Then, in years 9 and 10, there is another unit focusing on Australia during the world wars.
For many Victorian students, that is the sum of Australian history taught across their secondary years.
At years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit covering the period from 1750-1918.
Three actions should urgently be taken to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become a standalone learning area like English, maths and science.
Because history is taught only as part of the humanities, it is given little space within the curriculum.
It is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves.
Historical skills, such as the analysis of evidence, are complex.
We must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the study of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory.
Students love familiarity.
So many of my former students decided against Australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch.
Knowledge of our history alone will not bridge our deep racial divides.
But without it, as the Victorian curriculum makes clear, the task is hopeless.

Aron Elís in a deciding match to qualify for Europe - Ísak substituted at half-time
Aron Elís Þrándarson will play a deciding match to qualify for Europe in the Danish Superliga.
Ísak Bergmann Jóhannesson only played the first half with top-seated Norrköping against the bottom team of Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aron Elís was a part of Danish club OB's squad when it reached the deciding match to qualify for the UEFA Europa League play-off round.
OB will face AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the deciding match, depending on which team will be ahead after the final round of the Superliga's top teams later today.
Aron Elís played the entire 1—1 match away against Horsens today, but OB won the previous match between the teams at home, 3–1, thereby winning the duel with a combined score of 4–2.
Ísak was part of Norrköping's starting lineup, which unexpectedly found itself down 2–0 at half-time against the bottom team of Falkenberg in the Allsvenskan.
Norrköping substituted three players at the start of the second half, and Ísak was one of those who had to go off.
Norrköping was able to equalise but Falkenberg scored in the 89th minute, making the score 3-2.
However, there was still time for Norrköping to equalise with a penalty at the last minute, 3–3.
Norrköping remains at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which has still a match to play.
The point was enough for Falkenberg to raise itself from the bottom seat for the time being, as it is now a point above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who have still a match to play.
Gathers sources on the National Festival in the age of Coronavirus
Anna Lilja Sigurðardóttir created the Facebook group "My National Festival 2020" to collect sources about the National Festival that inhabitants of the Westman Islands intend to hold in the coming weekend.
Many intend to put up a tent in their garden and party with friends and family.
Anna Lilja talked to Hvati in the programme Helgin on Bylgjan.
"Nothing has been posted yet, which is also very exciting because there are now 600 members in the group so people are obviously intending to do something," says Anna Lilja.
Some Westman Island residents are going to have a tent party in their garden.
"People have talked about having their own [festival], maybe put up a tent in their garden and gather the family together, like people always do at this time," says Anna.
"You expect people to spend time with their next of kin.
However, she says that it's likely that many simply won't be there "but still intend to hold a small national festival somewhere else."
The festival committee is now busy refunding the tickets that were bought, but Anna believes that many locals are more interested in securing tickets to next year's festival.
"People are even investing in tickets now to have them valid for 2021."
"I'm a great fan of the National Festival, love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something that you have no control over just enters your life and then that's just the way it is," says Anna (it's reportedly quite common for people to ask whether Westman Islands people can't skip the festival "just this once").
Anna Lilja says that she did not create the group for herself or encourage people to hold their own National Festival but rather to gather sources on this year's Bank Holiday Weekend celebrations in the Westman Islands.
"What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this for anything. There is a possibility for those who use sources like these for something, but I was just creating a venue for people to submit what they're doing."
The annual bonfire on Fjósaklettur has also been built.
"I think many people are excited to have a bonfire on Friday night.
Of course, the only problem is that the forecast is nothing special."
"This bonfire will be lit but it remains to be seen how it will be," says Anna Lilja.
The complete interview with Anna Lilja can be heard in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be named in new sex dossier?
Royal prepares to fight back against possible disclosure in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
US Judge ordered release of secret documents relating to Epstein and Maxwell
The 80 pages of documents contain sections of Maxwell's 2016 testimonies
Release of the pages could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew as they include communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in 2015 court papers that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew
Prince Andrew is preparing to fight back against the possible disclosure this week of further damaging allegations about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
US District Judge Loretta Preska last week ordered the release of 80 secret legal documents, running to hundreds of pages, relating to Maxwell and Epstein.
The publication of the vast tranche of papers would be a blow for Maxwell, 58, as they feature large sections of testimony she gave to lawyers in 2016, including what her legal team said was "intrusive questioning" about her sex life.
They could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew because one of the documents includes communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in court papers that she was forced to have sex with the Prince on three occasions.
Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the claims.
A leaked email from 2015 that was revealed last year by the BBC appears to suggest that Andrew asked for Maxwell's help in dealing with Ms Roberts's claims.
We have no doubt the Duke will be vindicated
In it, he told the socialite: "Let me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."
Maxwell replied: "Have some info. Call me when you have a moment."
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: "The Duke of York has done nothing wrong, so we are relaxed about the unsealing of any court documents.
As the US courts have been at pains to point out, just because an allegation is included in court papers does not make them true.
"The US courts have urged the media and public to treat any allegations contained in court papers with extreme caution.
We entirely concur.
We have no doubt the Duke will be completely vindicated in the weeks ahead."
Maxwell is being held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial for recruiting and grooming some of Epstein's underage victims between 1994 and 1997.
She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge in legal depositions of his abuse.
She denies all the allegations.
Maxwell was interviewed by lawyers in April and July 2016 as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Roberts, who now goes by her married surname Giuffre.
About 40 of 418 pages of that testimony were made public last year, but following last week's ruling by Judge Preska in New York, further sections could be unsealed as early as Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers were given a week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year while he was awaiting trial for sex offences.
Detectives hunt gang after 'violent' street attack in Edinburgh
A man has been left with potentially life-changing injuries after he was attacked by three others in Edinburgh.
The 29-year-old victim was seriously assaulted in Drum Street, in the Gilmerton area, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
Police Scotland said he was taken to the city's Royal Infirmary with serious injuries.
Det Con Dale Miles, the officer leading the investigation, said: "This was a violent and unprovoked attack."
The suspects fled in the direction of Newtoft Street.
One was described as being in his 30s, 6ft and of muscular build.
He had short, dark hair and was wearing a white top, dark trousers and dark shoes.
Det Con Miles added: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident and saw anything suspicious to come forward."
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
The US Ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, wishes to carry a gun in Iceland and wants increased security.
He is said to have been "paranoid" about his safety since coming here last year.
This is according to a report by CBS where it was also stated that this was Gunter's wish despite working in "one of the safest countries in the world."
Gunter is said to have asked the US State Department to request that Icelandic government allow him to carry a gun.
He has also asked for an armoured car and a vest to protect him from knife stabs.
CBS sources say that the Department has repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
According to the CBS report, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request concerning Gunter's potential carrying of arms had been received from the United States, as the government does not comment on the security arrangements of foreign diplomats.
However, the news agency's sources say that no request was submitted.
CBS also quotes its sources as saying that Gunter had been told not to make efforts to carry arms because that would be considered an insult in this country.
Gunter has no diplomatic experience but has worked for years as a dermatologist in California.
He is an active member of the Republican Party and an enthusiastic supporter of President Donald Trump.
His recent tweet about the "invisible China Virus" raised eyebrows in Iceland.
CBS sources also claim that Gunter has had a considerable negative effect on morale within the US Embassy in Reykjavík.
That he has already had seven Deputy Chiefs of Mission since May of last year.
He has accused them of being members of the so-called "Deep State", which is allegedly a network of American officials working to undermine Trump, and responded angrily when one carried snow into his office.
When the ambassador attended a conference in Washington DC last February, he refused to return for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter allegedly wanted to work remotely from California and Minister of State Mike Pompeo ultimately had to order him to return, which he did in May.
Home form vital for Jose Mourinho as boss says it will be easier for Tottenham when fans return to stadiums
Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.
Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.
The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.
"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game," he said.
"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you."
Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.
But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.
"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams."
"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important."
"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.
I can imagine that victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
This is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step."
Buyers quick to act on coveted Lovely Banks lifestyle property
The bigger is better philosophy clearly rang true for the new owners of a sprawling Lovely Banks property that's just sold for $1.277m.
Buyers seeking a lifestyle address not far from central Geelong lined up to inspect the 1.35ha offering that has garaging for 14 cars, a swimming pool and views over Corio Bay.
Harcourts, North Geelong agent Joe Grgic said 1 Cuddihy Court went under offer within 10 days of hitting the market.
Ocean Grove's restored Broome Cottage up for sale
Homes perfect for self-isolation
"We had multiple offers from different parties," Mr Grgic said.
"It sold to a local guy who is very excited."
The property comes with a two-storey, four-bedroom house that includes a huge ensuite, large enough to accommodate a couch.
The new owners will also enjoy three living areas, a renovated kitchen and an updated outdoor entertainment area overlooking the pool.
"It was the combination of the lifestyle property, being three acres, and it's right there," Mr Grgic said.
"I had some Melbourne buyers come down and they couldn't believe its proximity to everything but yet it had that rural feel.
"I actually have people who missed out and buyers that are still looking."
He said the generous shedding, which includes a double garage and separate shed which can accommodate 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for tradies or storing caravans and trailers.
Believes his security threatened in Iceland
"Despite being assigned to one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been "paranoid" about his security since coming to Reykjavik last year."
Thus begins CBS News' detailed coverage of the US Ambassador to Iceland, quoting numerous sources from within the United States foreign service.
The CBS report maintains that he wanted the State Department to obtain special permission from the Icelandic government for him to have a firearm.
He is also said to have requested an armoured car and entertained ideas of wearing a vest that could protect him from knife attacks.
The State Department declined to say if there is any credible threat to Gunter's safety, but according to U.S. government officials, the ambassador has been informed multiple times that he is at no extraordinary risk.
Regardless, the US Embassy in Iceland recently placed a jobs listing, including in Morgunblaðið on 18 July, looking for full-time bodyguards, but CBS sources say that this was done to placate Gunter's concerns.
The State Department does not comment on specific security measures for their embassies, but says that the goal is always to provide security by proactive means.
The State Department did not answer questions about Gunter's desire to arm himself and the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs declines to confirm whether the U.S. officially sought permission for the ambassador to carry a firearm, adding that they generally do not comment on the security details of diplomatic missions.
However, CBS sources in Iceland said that such a request was never made, and three US officials claimed that Gunter was talked out of these plans as they could cause offence to Icelanders.
The CBS report also addresses the various problems around the US Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed last year, including the fact that he has already replaced seven Deputy Chiefs of Mission.
The first deputy is said to have prepared extensively, including learning Icelandic, only to be refused the post at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like the look of him" at their first meeting.
His successors haven't fared much better under Gunter's command.
Senior leadership at the State Department is reportedly aware of the situation at the US Embassy in Iceland, but has been reluctant to interfere in matters closely connected to the President.
In addition to all this, Gunter is said to be unwilling to follow various foreign service protocols and respect the chain of command.
In February, after attending a conference in Washington, Gunter allegedly refused to return to Iceland, leaving a temporary deputy in charge of his post for months, in the middle of a pandemic.
Gunter is even said to have requested to work remotely and stated that he would not return to Iceland unless specifically asked to do so by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
According to a statement from the State Department, Gunter had decided to go on personal leave after the conference and his return was further delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, but according to CBS sources, many within the Department had asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he didn't do so until May, when Pompeo contacted him and asked him to please return to the US Embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also notes Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, particularly in relation to a heavily criticised tweet where he referred to the coronavirus as "the invisible China Virus".
Gunter is one of many ambassadors with practically no diplomatic experience who have been appointed under President Donald Trump.
Sachin Pilot Vs Ashok Gehlot; BJP Says State In Political Crisis; Congress Wants Floor Test
Ashok Gehlot said if necessary, Congress hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's home.
A day after leading a dharna at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said if necessary, the Congress MLAs will meet the President and hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's residence to settle the crisis in the state.
At a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Mr Gehlot indicated that the plan was to have a floor test to prove that the majority of Congress MLAs and allies are with him in the tussle for power.
"He said the government has the majority and wants to go to the assembly floor," a statement issued by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi after the CLP meeting said.
The CLP meeting was held at the hotel where the MLAs in the Gehlot camp are holed up for days.
"The chief minister asked us to remain prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If required, he said, we would go to meet the President and would also hold a dharna outside the prime minister's residence," a party leader said.
The Rajasthan Governor must call an assembly session to let the Congress prove its majority, party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said, alleging that the BJP's conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government was now clear.
"The country is ruled in accordance with the law and constitution.
Governments are formed and run based on people's mandate.
BJP's conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is clear.
This is an insult to 8 crore people of Rajasthan.
The governor must call assembly session so that the truth comes before the country," Mr Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told Congress MLAs on Saturday that he was ready to go to the President of India to make sure that what he calls a "BJP conspiracy" to stall a test of strength does not succeed.
Mr Gehlot, who protested for hours at Governor Kalraj Mishra's home on Friday to press for an assembly session, held meetings with Congress MLAs and his cabinet on Saturday, after which a fresh proposal was drawn up and passed by the cabinet.
Mr Mishra had last night asked Mr Gehlot to re-submit the request for an assembly session, citing six objections.
This proposal will be sent to the Governor soon.
Mr Gehlot has accused the Governor of delaying the session because he is "under pressure" to stall his government's test of strength.
As Mr Gehlot met with his cabinet, a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP leader Satish Poonia and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met the Governor to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the state.
Car on fire just outside Borgarnes
Traffic direction was required when a car caught on fire just beyond the golf clubhouse Hamar in Borgarnes shortly before four o'clock.
According to the Borgarnes fire brigade, efforts to put out the fire in the car were successful, and the car is expected to be moved soon.
There were two men in the car when the fire broke out due to a technical malfunction in the car, but both are safe and completely unharmed.
Traffic had to be directed while firefighting work was underway as there is heavy traffic in both directions in the area.
Actress Spencer Grammer slashed outside Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK -- Actress Spencer Grammer says she was trying to calm an agitated man when he slashed her in the arm and stabbed her friend in the back Friday outside a New York City restaurant.
Grammer, 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend "did what anyone else would do in the same situation" and were "attempting to prevent the altercation from escalating" when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were eating at an outside table at The Black Ant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood around 11:30 p.m.
Friday when the man ambled up and demanded to be served as the restaurant was closing down.
Grammer and her friend were hurt as they "attempted to break up a dispute between the unidentified male and other patrons at the location," police said.
The man ran away after wounding Grammer in the right arm and her friend in the lower back with an unknown sharp object, police said.
No arrests have been made.
Grammer, who provides the voice of Summer on "Rick and Morty" and previously starred on the ABC Family series "Greek," is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said she and her friend both expect to recover quickly.
Neither suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In her statement to Us Weekly, Grammer thanked the first responders and Bellevue Hospital staff that treated them and noted the "incredible battle" those workers have fought against the coronavirus pandemic.
"It was very moving for us to have the opportunity to thank them in person," Grammer said.
'I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people' - Chimaev after making history on UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.
Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.
The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.
The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.
Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.
"I do this not only for me, I do this for everybody I can help.
I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, to show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," replied Chimaev when asked on Fight Island about how he would spend his bonus.
One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev "easily."
That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would "smash Danis with his eyes closed."
Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.
"I can smash everybody...
How many fighters in the welterweight division?
I can smash all of them," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos (welterweight) champion, 84 kilos (middleweight) champion, I'm going to smash both of them, same day."
Israelis continue protests against PM's handling of pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Israelis held several demonstrations across the country against their prime minister Saturday, with the main protest taking place in Jerusalem outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu.
The protests have been going on for the past few weeks, sparked by what critics see as a government failure to handle the coronavirus crisis after initially keeping the threat of the virus at bay.
Corruption charges against Netanyahu have further fueled the demonstrations.
"Bibi, go home," read one sign held by a protester.
Another placard read "Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes."
Hundreds of protesters Saturday also gathered outside Netanyahu's beach house in the upscale town of Caesarea.
Last week, police used water cannons to disperse crowds in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a hasty and erratic reopening of the economy in May, infections shot up with the average number of new cases daily at 2,000.
The country's economy has been battered by virus restrictions and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to nearly 20%.
Protesters say the government's offers of financial assistance have been nowhere near enough.
The protests came in the shadow of Netanyahu's corruption trial which resumed this month.
Hearings will start in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals.
Hundreds Of Demonstrators Gather In Downtown LA In Solidarity With Portland Protesters
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - About 300 protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of a two-month-long movement in Portland, Oregon, where federal law enforcement officials are under scrutiny after clashes with protesters.
There were similar rallies throughout the U.S. in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and other cities.
The L.A. demonstrations were organized by the groups Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The crowd marched to the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters at First and Main streets, then to the Metropolitan Detention Center.
Participants also moved to the Alameda offramp of the 101 Freeway, but later left.
Some of the people in the group were seen breaking windows of the downtown federal building and federal signage has been graffitied with profanities.
At least one arrest was made during the protests.
50 People To Be Allowed In Mosques On Eid, No Mass Prayers In Eidgah: Karnataka
Eid-ul-Azha, also known as Bakrid, would be celebrated on July 31 and August 1.
The Karnataka government has allowed Eid-ul-Azha prayers only in mosques with a maximum of 50 people at a time and said mass prayers at Eidgah and other places are prohibited in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
People visiting mosques for the prayers have to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, Minority Welfare and Wakf Department Secretary AB Ibrahim said in an order.
It said the Hilal committee has decided that the Eid-ul- Azha, also known as Bakrid, would be celebrated on July 31 in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts while it would be on August 1 in the rest of the state.
Noting that mass prayers were one of the important rituals Muslims perform during Bakrid, the order said in view of the COVID-19 pandemic such events at Eidgah and other places were prohibited.
However, prayers would be allowed in mosques with the restriction that not more than 50 people should take part.
If there were more people, the prayers should be performed in batches, the department said in the order.
Mass prayers should not be performed in any other places such as halls, community buildings and "Shadi Mahal," the order added.
Karnataka allowed temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open for devotees from June 8 with all COVID-19 preventive measures in place.
The US Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, US Ambassador to Iceland, believes that his life is under threat here and wants to carry arms.
In early 2020, the US Embassy advertised repeatedly for bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and in fact used the English word "bodyguard" in the advertisement.
According to Kveikur's sources, the main reason for these jobs being advertised is ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter's belief that his life is under threat in Iceland.
Kveikur has spoken to sources in Iceland and abroad who say that the ambassador is convinced that he's in grave danger because of his Jewish origin.
It's not as clear what the threat is, but those who Kveikur spoke with said that the threat of Islamic terrorists had been mentioned.
CBS Television published a report on the matter on its website this morning, quoting Washington sources who maintain that Gunter is paranoid, insisting on carrying arms himself, getting a stab-proof vest and having an armed security detail, as well as a bullet-proof car.
CBS sources claim that Gunter has been told repeatedly that there is no threat and the advertisement for a "bodyguard" was only to sooth Gunter.
According to Kveikur's sources, the positions had not been filled at the end of June while the application deadline was in February.
According to Kveikur's sources the US Embassy has not sent a formal request regarding these changes.
There has neither been a formal request for increased security nor for permission to have armed bodyguards outside the walls of the embassy.
That is explicitly prohibited by Icelandic law, except with a special authorisation from the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.
Those who Kveikur spoke to within the administration say that there is no information on any kind of threat.
The National Commissioner's latest risk assessment is rather unambiguous when it comes to terrorist threat.
There are said to be no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no indications of terrorist or extremist groups being active here.
There are no grounds for allowing bodyguards employed by foreign embassies to carry arms in Icelandic streets, according to Kveikur's sources.
Gunter attracted considerable attention in Iceland when he retweeted the US President's tweet and referred to COVID-19 as the "China Virus".
The tweet was accompanied by a picture of the US and Icelandic flags.
Seattle radio host who mocked Trump's reaction to protests now says he needs a gun after Starbucks below his apartment is trashed - RT USA News
Paul Gallant has a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump in June for saying anarchists were burning and pillaging Seattle.
All it took was for the mayhem to come near the talk show host's home.
"I feel like I need to buy a firearm because this is clearly going to keep happening," Gallant said Saturday night on Twitter after coming home to see the Starbucks coffeeshop below his apartment complex "destroyed" by vandals.
"Enough is enough. It looks like a block party down the street from me. Really angry right now."
The reaction stood in stark contrast to last month, when Trump complained that Seattle's mayor was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Dems don't have a clue," the president said.
"The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it's just wonderful, even the death."
Gallant, who co-hosts the 'Danny & Gallant'show on Seattle's ESPN radio affiliate, tweeted in response: "Walked through it last night out of curiosity and saw no burning, pillaging or deaths. Chill dawg."
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building because explosives could be inside the damaged Starbucks.
He posted pictures of the damage, saying, "Great job a - holes," and noted that he'd also seen a fire a few blocks away.
"Zero clue what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The turnabout didn't go unnoticed, as conservatives ridiculed Gallant for his earlier view, tweeting messages such as "Just chill dawg," and "Huh, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio host, said, "Guess we're finally doing that field trip we discussed."
Gallant acknowledged the humor: "Woke up to a bunch of people tweeting 'chill dawg' at me. I laughed."
He said he stood by his earlier statement, as he had walked through the CHAZ autonomous zone created by anarchists and found it to be less bad than it was portrayed.
"Then burning and pillaging actually happened," he said. "Classic."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, goes house-hunting with her 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harries
They started dating on the set of White Lines, a drama about debauchery on Ibiza - but when Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went house-hunting last week, they cut an image of relaxed calm far from the hedonism of the party island.
The couple, who played brother and sister in the hit Netflix series, were spotted as they viewed a stunning Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is on the market for £1.2 million.
They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing denim shorts and a white top, and were met by an estate agent who ushered them inside for a look around the five-bedroom home.
In White Lines, which was filmed last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who discovers the seedy side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her DJ brother Axel, played by 28-year-old Tom.
News of their relationship only emerged earlier this month, less than a year after the collapse of Laura's six-year marriage to Sam Claflin, who starred in The Hunger Games films.
Together they have a son, four-year-old Pip, and a daughter Margot, two.
When they announced their split last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition and Sam, who's also been in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as "easily one of his greatest achievements."
Before White Lines, Laura appeared in the first Inbetweeners film and last year's BBC crime-drama The Capture, playing lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom has appeared in the Inbetweeners sequel and Sky drama Britannia.
Believes it too early to declare another wave in this country
An expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department believes it's too early to declare another wave of the pandemic.
Three new domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of Landspítali hospital yesterday, and tens of people are in quarantine.
Two domestic infections were diagnosed on Thursday, one in a man in his twenties and another in a man in his teens.
These were the first diagnosed infections since the beginning of the month.
Three additional domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday, including one in someone who had been at the Rey Cup football tournament in Laugardalur.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, press officer for the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, told the news agency yesterday that fewer people had to be tested because of this infection than originally thought.
One infection is in an individual who entered the country from abroad on 15 July.
By then, the rules on the so-called return hygiene measures had entered into effect.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department, says that the individual in question followed the old procedure.
His test was negative upon his entry into the country, but he later became sick, has now been isolated, and six people have been quarantined.
They are all about to be tested and two have become symptomatic.
The third infection is connected to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday, and twelve people have been quarantined in connection with that.
It has come to light that this is a new variation of the coronavirus that has not been previously diagnosed in this country.
"We don't know exactly where this type of virus comes from, but we have not seen it before.
The one who is believed to have brought the virus into the country had been in Israel but also other European countries."
She believes it's too early to declare that the so-called second wave of the pandemic has begun in this country, like other European countries fear.
"While the majority is still traceable, it is not obvious that this is the case.
But we are vigilant and observant, and thinking of ways to respond if something like this would start up."
Megan Fox speaks up about the relationship
Megan Fox says that she found her twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
"As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in astrology and I knew at once that this was my twin soul," says Fox, who is 34 years old.
"A twin soul is where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time," Fox explained.
"Thus we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him that as soon as we met.
I felt it at once."
"When we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, where I told him about the astrological signs and asked him about his life.
I decided to go deep right away."
Machine Gun Kelly, who got to know her during the shooting of a film, concurs.
"I was beginning to hang outside her trailer in the hope of seeing her.
She has the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced her husband of ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologises to Kim
American musician, fashion mogul and presidential candidate Kanye West has apologised to his wife, Kim Kardashian West, for his public comments on the family's private matters.
Yesterday evening, he tweeted "I would like to apologise to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter."
There has been much speculation on the status of their relationship as Kanye has expressed himself unreservedly on social media and held a rally on Monday where he talked about the birth of his daughter, North West, claiming that he almost killed her.
Kim came forward on Wednesday, posting a message to her Instagram followers where she discussed the health condition of her husband, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Until now, Kardashian West has refrained from discussing her husband's condition publicly, saying that she does so in consideration of their children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health.
Major stars who make their own wine
Many stars are involved in wine production of some sort.
It seems to be popular among them to be involved in some kind of business operation when they are not performing on the silver screen or singing for an audience of millions.
US Racial Injustice Protests Mount
Protesters have taken to the streets of several U.S. cities to bring attention to racial injustice.
Protests in Portland, Oregon, have been going in for two months, since the May 25 death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal officers to Portland, adding additional fuel to the protests.
The demonstrators now are also protesting the federal presence in the city.
In Seattle, police using flash bangs and tear gas arrested 45 people Saturday after demonstrations in support or the protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
Saturday night, in Austin, Texas, a man was killed when someone shot into a Black Lives Matter march.
Media accounts say the man may have approached a vehicle with a rifle before he was fired upon.
"All I know is that someone dying while protesting is horrible," Mayor Steve Adler of Austin said in a statement.
Adler said he is "heartbroken and stunned."
In Louisville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters called for justice of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who died in Louisville when police entered her home without warning on a "no knock" warrant and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had fired at the officers first, thinking they were intruders.
One police officer has been fired because of the Taylor incident, but charges have not been brought against the other officers.
The leader of the NFAC group, an armed Black militia involved in the protests, says he wants the police investigation into the Taylor killing to be more transparent.
Police say three NFAC members were injured Saturday when one of the militia's weapons accidentally discharged.
Potential group infection underway
Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infections this week outside border screenings.
Two of those infected were diagnosed as having a previously unseen variant of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether these persons were infected by a tourist who has since left the country or an asymptomatic Icelander who is then likely to have infected many more.
The acting Chief Epidemiologist says that a potential group infection may be underway in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in Iceland last Thursday, each with their own variant of the virus.
The origin of the infections is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed yesterday; one was infected by one of the two diagnosed on Thursday, one came to the country on 15 July and was probably infected overseas, while the third also has an infection with an unclear origin.
A sequence analysis by deCODE Genetics revealed that the two connected persons who were diagnosed with the virus have a new variant that has not been diagnosed before in this country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and acting Chief Epidemiologist, says that deCODE Genetics is now reviewing the mostly likely origin of this type of the virus.
"One instance was similar to a virus that has been seen in Switzerland although it wasn't exactly the same.
They are going to look into this, try to map it out in more detail and deduce in which part of the world the infection originates," she says.
"It seems to be from this side of the Atlantic, however."
The infections are therefore unrelated to the two infections in early July that were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new type comes from abroad rather than having mutated in this country?
"Yes, it's so unlike what has been found here before that there's really no likelihood of it having been brewing here," answers Kamilla.
"Instead, everything points to these persons having come into some contact with a person who has just arrived from overseas, without them being aware of it themselves."
When asked, she says that there are still no indications as to from where this new virus could have entered the country.
"It could of course be a tourist who has since left the country, but it could also be someone who is asymptomatic and doesn't realise that they are infected, in which case more infections could obviously follow.
We will be watching this closely over the next few days."
As yet, we don't see anything that is a clear group infection.
But there are persons who went into quarantine in connection with one of the infections yesterday who now have symptoms and have been tested," Kamilla continues.
"We don't have the results yet.
So a group infection is possibly underway."
Do you assume that there are community-acquired infections now?
"It cannot be ruled out.
We have not seen them recently but it cannot be ruled out because we don't know who may have infected the persons who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday," she replies.
Could this be characterised as the start of a new wave of the virus?
"No, not yet.
But we have to be very vigilant, of course, and keep in mind that there are certain limits to how many tests we can do.
We don't test asymptomatic people, but since we are seeing infections that seem to be untraceable we have to have some more freedom as regards testing people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, you can expect Landspítali's bacterial and virology department to increase testing in the coming days in order to better map out the domestic situation.
Has Landspítali Hospital the capacity to increase domestic testing and handle border screening?
"Not unlimited, no.
That is why there has to be some basis for testing persons who are not part of the screening projects; the person in question must be in quarantine and be symptomatic or have had symptoms, and suspect that they have come into contact with someone who has just come to the country, or something like that," says Kamilla.
She notes that the infections diagnosed yesterday are still being traced, and that great efforts are being made to gather information on where these persons have been.
She says that the origin of the domestic infections seems to be untraceable but does not rule out that some of those who have been quarantined may provide clues that could lead the tracing team to the original infections.
The restaurant that most people don't know about but is considered one of the best
Not everyone is sure where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located, and it probably has more fans abroad than in Iceland, judging from the comments about it on TripAdvisor and other sites.
It should come as no surprise that there have been reports of people flying to Iceland with the express purpose of visiting it.
Food blogger and cookbook author Berglind Hreiðarsdóttir visited Bjargarsteinn recently and could hardly contain her enthusiasm.
"I don't know where to begin because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn in Grundarfjörður is simply a wonderful place.
The history of the house is the cutest I've heard, the food is top-notch, the view is great and the waiters are wonderfully entertaining," says Berglind.
"Gunni, Bjargarsteinn's owner, produced one delicious dish after another for us.
My husband, me and our girls spent a whole evening eating, which should be an indication of how good the food was," Berglind adds.
"The building that houses the restaurant is an old residential house that was moved in one piece to Grundarfjörður.
The current owners saw the house for sale in Akranes, found a pretty seaside lot in Grundarfjörður and made their dream come true.
Bjargarsteinn's website contains more information on the history of the house."
"The household items and whole environment at Bjargarsteinn are unique.
Items from the whole family have been collected, which lend the premises a unique air.
There is a parlour on the second floor, and it's really cozy and homelike to come into this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking expertise are obvious and much effort is clearly made to produce tasty and good-looking food," says Berglind and judging from the photos, every word is true.
Sebastian Vettel to Red Bull: F1 star tipped to join Max Verstappen due to one team member
"That is a definite no I am afraid, and Sebastian is aware of that."
F1 returns next weekend with the first of two back-to-back races at Silverstone.
Lewis Hamilton will look to extend his lead after winning two of the opening three Grand Prix since the sport finally returned amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Vettel will be hoping from some improved performance from his Ferrari which has been off the pace so far.
Mick Fleetwood pays tribute to Peter Green: 'His music will live on'
Mick Fleetwood has paid tribute to Peter Green, the co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today aged 73.
Green was an original member of the iconic rock group, alongside the aforementioned Mick, as well as Jeremy Spencer.
Despite leaving the band in 1970 before their greatest successes with albums like Rumours, Mick has paid tribute to his former bandmate, assuring fans that "his music will live on."
Fleetwood told PA: "For me, and every past and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is monumental.
"Peter was the man who started the band Fleetwood Mac along with myself, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever stepped into the ranks of Fleetwood Mac without a reverence for Peter Green and his talent, and to the fact that music should shine bright and always be delivered with uncompromising passion."
The 73 year old rock legend added: "Peter, I will miss you, but rest easy your music lives on.
I thank you for asking me to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did good, and trail blazed one hell of a musical road for so many to enjoy.
"God speed to you, my dearest friend....... Love Mick Fleetwood."
Confirming Green's death, a statement from Swan Turton solicitors read: "It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
"A further statement will be provided in the coming days."
Green is survived by his daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, who she shared with ex-wife Jane Samuels.
Green formed Fleetwood Mac with bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, with the band originally called Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer.
However, the singer-songwriter would leave the group in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would go on to achieve great acclaim and worldwide fame with additional line-ups including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on seminal albums including Rumours and Tusk.
Prince Joachim said to be in a stable condition
Prince Joachim, the younger son of Margrethe Þórhildur, Queen of Denmark, and the late Prince Henrik of Denmark, is still in hospital in Toulouse, France, where he underwent surgery on a blood clot in his brain the day before yesterday.
DR, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, quoted a spokesman of the Danish court as saying that it was unclear how long the prince, who is 51, will remain in the hospital, but that his condition was stable.
According to DR's report, tests are now being conducted to determine the effects of the blood clot on the prince's health.
According to DR's health correspondent, physician Peter Qvortrup Geisling, the effects of a blood clot in the brain often do not become apparent until days after the operation.
According to Geisling, "they can include anything from negligible symptoms to hemiplegia, memory problems or difficulty expressing oneself."
He says that the prince may have to go through many months of rehabilitation.
Prince Joachim, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and who is also Count of Monpezat, was staying at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in the South of France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the nearby town of Cahors before being transferred to the Tolouse University Hospital where he underwent surgery on a blood clot in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 able to photograph Milky Way
Along with adding 2x optical zoom, the second lens allows the Pixel 4 to see in 3D; thus doing a better job of blurring the background in portrait mode than previous Pixel handsets, which relied purely on software to achieve this "bokeh" effect.
To establish the camera's credentials, Google brought legendary portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to talk about her experience shooting with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machine learning is still a strong focus for every aspect of Google's new smartphones, relying on "computational photography" to improve its HDR+ mode by combining up to nine different images.
New dual exposure controls offer separate sliders for brightness and shadows, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real-time.
The phone also relies on machine learning for improved auto white balance and an enhanced Night Sight night mode, which is sensitive enough to capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
Beyond the second camera lens, the Pixel 4 introduces a Soli "radar chip" front sensor which recognises Motion Sense gestures, allowing users to skip music, dismiss timers, snooze alarms or silence their phone with a wave of their hand.
All Motion Sense computations run in the device rather than connecting to the internet, as does the improved Google Assistant, as the tech giant focused on both reducing response times and enhancing user privacy.
Google's continued push to make the most of its machine learning capabilities has also spawned a new voice recorder app which transcribes audio live, without sending data to the internet.
For now the app only supports in English, with more languages to come.
The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support the Google Stadia cloud gaming platform, which opens its doors on November 19 in the US but is yet to receive an Australian launch date.
Beyond the new Pixel handsets, Google also unveiled a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook and second-generation Google Pixel Buds.
Arriving next year, but not confirmed for Australia, the new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and feature adaptive audio which monitors your environment and continually adjusts the sound to provide optimal clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and adjust the sound to the noise levels around you.
Meanwhile, Google also announced an upgrade to its mesh Wi-Fi home routers in the Nest WiFi, relying on a new separate router combined with several base stations working in unison to improve wireless coverage through the home.
Adopting the Nest name, the new Wi-Fi system doubles the range of its predecessor and adds a built-in microphone and speaker for using Google Assistant on each base station around the home.
It launches in Australia on November 5, for $399 with the router and one Wi-Fi point, or $549 AUD with a second Wi-Fi point.
The Google Home Mini also received an upgrade, with the new $79 Nest Mini improving sound quality - doubling the bass - and adding an integrated wall mount.
All Google smart speakers are set to receive a new intercom feature for communicating between devices in the home, plus the ability to call the Nest Mini from outside the home using the Google Home app.
MATCHDAY: Final day of Premier League; Juve can seal title
A look at what's happening around European soccer on Sunday:
It's the last day of the season and plenty is still at stake: Champions League and Europa League qualification, the final two relegation places, and the Golden Boot scoring trophy.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester are fighting for the remaining two Champions League qualification positions behind champion Liverpool and second-place Manchester City.
The three teams are separated by one point and Leicester hosts United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenham are battling for a finish in the Europa League spots.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth are looking to avoid the two remaining relegation spots alongside already-demoted Norwich.
With one game left, Leicester's Jamie Vardy is the top scorer with 23 goals, two ahead of Southampton's Danny Ings and three clear of Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
The playoffs for promotion to the Premier League begin with Swansea hosting Brentford in the first leg of their semifinal.
Fulham plays Cardiff in the other semifinal starting Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich have already been promoted from the second-tier Championship.
Juventus can win a record-extending ninth successive Serie A title with a win over Sampdoria.
That would take the Bianconeri seven points clear of second-placed Inter Milan with two matches remaining.
At the other end of the table, Lecce needs a win at Bologna to boost its chances of avoiding relegation.
Lecce is four points below 17th-placed Genoa, which has played a game more.
Angler 'seen throwing beer bottle at seal' in Devon
An angler threw a beer bottle at a seal when it interfered with his fishing line, a charity has said.
Photos taken at Hope's Nose, near Torquay, appear to show a man hurling a projectile at the creature from a cliff.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the angler emptied the bottle and launched it, hitting the animal on the back.
Mr Kenny called it "appalling and inconsiderate behaviour."
He said he was collecting litter at the Devon beauty spot with members of the Seal Project conservation charity when he witnessed the attack on Sunday morning.
"The seal made an attempt to get the fishing line," he said.
"The angler finished his beer, drained the bottle and threw it at the seal.
"The bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off."
Mr Kenny said that "fortunately seals are robust creatures," but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature.
"By throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting," he said.
The Seal Project said it was "not an isolated case" and it had received "numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently."
In a Facebook post, it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during Sunday's visit to Hope's Nose and observed "multiple examples of antisocial behaviour."
All seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and people are advised to stay away from them.
A giant from Kristnipollur in Laxá in Dalir
The first 100 cm salmon in Laxá in Dalir was caught this afternoon.
The angler was Arnór Ísfjörð Guðmundsson.
He had caught an 89 cm long female in Kristnipollur.
Kristnipollur became available to him again in the afternoon, and he was reminded of a story he had heard about how the male often took the bait after the female had been caught.
With this in mind, he cast his fly, a Collie Dog, over Kristnipollur.
He soon detected a strike, and in his own words:
"In about five seconds, it cleared itself completely and I realised that it was a one-metre fish.
I was a little stressed out as I had an eleven-pound leader.
I usually pull hard on fish but I worked on this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was rather easy to deal with.
He took a few trips up and down the hole before I managed to land it, which was a wonderful feeling.
I threw the rod away and jumped on it.
It measured at 102 cm and I measured it twice," said the happy angler when Sporðaköst caught up with him in the fishing lodge Þrándargil at Laxá í Dalir.
Actually, Arnór is no novice when it comes to 100 cm salmons.
This was his eighth.
He has caught such fish in Blanda, Svartá, Hraunsfjörður, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá and one in Eystri Rangá.
Arnór says that fishing is good in Laxá in Dalir.
The group that finishes tomorrow has caught 35 salmon, eighteen of them caught by our man.
Massive flooding expected due to Hanna
Hurricane Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane of this year, reached the Texas shore last night.
Although Hanna soon lost power and turned into a storm, there has been heavy rain in the area and extensive flooding is expected.
Up to 30 centimetres of rain is expected to fall in a single day, with up to 46 centimetres in some places, according to the Associated Press.
The flash floods that may occur due to the rain are expected to be particularly dangerous.
The area where Hanna came ashore has been suffering because of the wide spread of the novel coronavirus there.
The sea also flooded the land, causing damage.
At least 43,700 people are now without electricity and evacuation shelters have been opened in the area.
President Donald Trump tweeted about the hurricane last night, saying that it was important for people to listen to experts and follow instructions.
Footage shot by an Associated Press cameraman this morning can be seen below.
Houses burned, shops looted and infrastructure damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more injured after an attack in the village of Masteri in Sudan's Darfur region yesterday.
The attack "was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks where houses were burned, shops and markets looted and infrastructure damaged," according to a statement today from the UN Humanitarian Office in the capital of Khartoum.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has declared that security forces will be sent to the war-torn region to "protect the inhabitants and the crops."
Only two days ago, unknown troops killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack in the area.
"The escalation of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased displacement, compromising the agriculture and threatening people's lives and livelihood," according to the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur in West Sudan began in 2003 when rebels, most of whom are non-Arab, rose up against the Khartoum government.
Government troops and Arab mercenaries who attempted to quell the rebellion have been accused of widespread atrocities, with approximately 300,000 killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations' estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, who was deposed as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, Sudan's new authorities are in peace negotiations with the main rebel groups.
TV reporter credits viewer with noticing cancerous lump
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A television news reporter in Florida is crediting an eagle-eyed viewer for noticing a lump on her neck and emailing her that she should get it checked out.
Victoria Price, a reporter for WFLA in Tampa, followed the advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price tweeted that she is undergoing surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, her thyroid and a couple of lymph nodes.
"Doctor said it's spreading, but not too much, and we're hopeful this will be my first and last procedure," she said.
The viewer emailed Price last month, saying the lump reminded her of one she had had.
Price, 28, an investigative reporter, said this week that her television station's catchphrase is "8 On Your Side."
"But the roles recently reversed when I found a viewer on MY side, and I couldn't be more grateful," Price said.
"I will be forever grateful for the woman who went out of her way to email me, a total stranger.
She had zero obligation to, but she did anyway.
Talk about being on your side, huh?"
Section Of Jeronimo Open Space Temporarily Closes After 2 Coyote Attacks - CBS Los Angeles
Two people were bit by coyotes near Oso Creek Trail along Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo Saturday morning, causing a temporary closure at the trail.
Laura Wittmer said she sees coyotes almost every morning when she's running and typically just tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning, one came directly toward her and bit her on the leg.
As investigations continue into the attacks, the trail has been closed.
The City of Mission Viejo said in a tweet, "Today, 2 different parties reported coyote bites to a human. MV Animal Services is working with the Department of Fish & Wildlife on this matter and a section of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Please be aware and vigilant when you are out where wildlife is prevalent."
Wittmer tried to fight the coyote off by hitting it with a water bottle.
She called 911 to get a ride to her car but was able to drive herself to the emergency room.
The coyote disappeared into the hills but officials are hoping to track it down and check it for rabies.
Meantime, Wittmer will undergo rabies treatments as a precaution over the next two weeks.
She said the scary encounter won't stop her from her early morning runs but that from now on, she'll choose a different spot.
The condition of the other coyote bite victim is unclear.
Anti-racism protesters clash with police in Seattle
Clashes in Seattle between police and anti-racism protesters resulted in dozens of arrests on Sunday, as public anger mounts over US President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into main cities.
Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have been ignited by the death in Minneapolis of unarmed African-American George Floyd in May.
Protesters in Seattle slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows during the demonstrations on Saturday, prompting police to declare a riot and clear the streets with pepper spray and flash-bang grenades.
Protesters also set fire to trailers by a construction site for a youth detention facility.
Police said 45 people were arrested while 21 officers were injured.
The march was in support of ongoing protests in nearby Portland, Oregon.
Portland has taken centre stage for the highly controversial crackdown by federal agents ordered by Trump -- one that is not supported by local officials, who say officers use excessive force.
Protesters have marched in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky; New York; Omaha, Nebraska; California's Oakland and Los Angeles, and Richmond in Virginia.
In Austin, a man was killed in a shooting that broke out Saturday night at a protest in the downtown area of the Texas state capital, police said.
The protests come as Trump faces an increasingly tough battle for re-election in November, and is campaigning on a "law and order" platform.
